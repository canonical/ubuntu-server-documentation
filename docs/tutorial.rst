Ubuntu Server tutorials
***********************

We hope our tutorials make as few assumptions as possible and are broadly
accessible to anyone with an interest in Ubuntu Server. They should also be a
good place to start learning about Ubuntu Server in general, how it works, and
what it’s capable of.

In our "Getting started" tutorial you will learn how to set up an Ubuntu
Server; from installing using a bootable USB device, to navigating the Server
installer menu.

Getting started
===============

* :ref:`Basic installation <basic-installation>`

**The Server installer**

The Ubuntu installer has its own documentation. For more guidance on installing
Ubuntu Server with the installer, you can also see these guides in the Ubuntu
installer documentation (note: these pages will redirect you).

* `Operating the Server installer`_
* `Screen-by-screen installer guide`_
* `Configuring storage`_
* `Troubleshooting the installer`_

Next steps
==========

Once your Ubuntu Server is up and running, you may be interested in this
collection of related tutorials and topics that will help you learn more about
how it works and what’s available to you. These tutorials can be viewed in any
order.

* :ref:`Attach your Ubuntu Pro subscription <attach-your-ubuntu-pro-subscription>`

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Server, take
a look at our :ref:`How-to guides <how-to>`. These have more in-depth detail
and can be applied to a broader set of applications.

Take a look at our :ref:`Reference section <reference>` when you need to
determine what commands are available, and how to interact with various tools.

Finally, for a better understanding of how Ubuntu Server works and how it can
be used and configured, our :ref:`Explanation section <explanation>` enables
you to expand your knowledge of the operating system and additional software.
