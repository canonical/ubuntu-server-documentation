# Ubuntu Server tutorial

This tutorial should be a good place to start learning about Ubuntu Server in
general, how it works, and what it's capable of.

In our "Getting started" tutorial you will learn how to set up an Ubuntu
Server; from installing using a bootable USB device, to navigating the Server
installer menu.

## Getting started

**The Server installer**

The Ubuntu installer has its own documentation. For more guidance on installing
Ubuntu Server with the installer, you can also see these guides in the Ubuntu
installer documentation (note: these pages will redirect you).
