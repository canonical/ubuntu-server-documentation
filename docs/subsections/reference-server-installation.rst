Server installation
********************

Although Ubuntu Server is flexible and designed to run on a wide range of 
hardware, you can refer to the following requirements page to see the
various architectures Ubuntu Server can be run on, and suggested minimal values
for memory and storage.

* :ref:`System requirements <system-requirements>`

**Automatic installation**

The Ubuntu installer now has its own documentation for automatic (or
"hands-off" installations). For more guidance on auto-installing Ubuntu with
the installer, you can refer to the following guides from the Ubuntu installer
documentation (note: these pages will redirect you outside of the Server
documentation).

* `Autoinstall config file reference`_
* `Autoinstall JSON schema`_
