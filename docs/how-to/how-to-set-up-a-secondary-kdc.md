# How to set up secondary KDC

Once you have one Key Distribution Center (KDC) on your network, it is good practice to have a secondary KDC in case the primary becomes unavailable. 

Also, if you have Kerberos clients that are on different networks (possibly separated by routers using NAT), it is wise to place a secondary KDC in each of those networks.

> **Note**:
> The native replication mechanism explained here relies on a cron job; it essentially dumps the DB on the primary and loads it back up on the secondary. You may want to take a look at using the `kldap` backend, which can use the OpenLDAP replication mechanism. This is explained further below.

## Install the required packages

First, install the packages, and when asked for the Kerberos and Admin server names enter the name of the Primary KDC:

```bash
sudo apt install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server
```

Once you have installed the packages, create the host principals for both KDCs. From a terminal prompt, enter:

```bash
$ kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey host/kdc01.example.com"
$ kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey host/kdc02.example.com"
```

> **Note**:
> The `kadmin` command defaults to using a principal like `username/admin@EXAMPLE.COM`, where `username` is your current shell user. If you need to override that, use `-p <principal-you-want>`.

Extract the **key file** for the `kdc02` principal, which is the server we are on:

```bash
$ sudo kadmin -p ubuntu/admin -q "ktadd host/kdc02.example.com"
```

Next, there needs to be a `kpropd.acl` file on each KDC that lists all KDCs for the realm. For example, on both the **primary and secondary KDC**, create `/etc/krb5kdc/kpropd.acl`:

```text
host/kdc01.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
host/kdc02.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
```

> **Note**:
> It's customary to allow both KDCs because one may want to switch their roles if one goes bad. For such an eventuality, both are already listed here.

Create an empty database on the **secondary KDC**:

```bash
$ sudo kdb5_util create -s
```

Now install `kpropd` daemon, which listens for connections from the `kprop` utility from the **primary KDC**:

```bash
$ sudo apt install krb5-kpropd
```

The service will be running immediately after installation.

From a terminal on the **primary KDC**, create a dump file of the principal database:

```bash
$ sudo kdb5_util dump /var/lib/krb5kdc/dump
```

Still on the **Primary KDC**, extract its **key**:

```bash
$ sudo kadmin.local -q "ktadd host/kdc01.example.com"
```

On the **primary KDC**, run the `kprop` utility to push the database dump made before to the secondary KDC:

```bash
$ sudo kprop -r EXAMPLE.COM -f /var/lib/krb5kdc/dump kdc02.example.com
Database propagation to kdc02.example.com: SUCCEEDED
```

Note the `SUCCEEDED` message, which signals that the propagation worked. If there is an error message, check `/var/log/syslog` on the secondary KDC for more information.

You may also want to create a cron job to periodically update the database on the **secondary KDC**. For example, the following will push the database every hour:

```bash
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 * * * * root /usr/sbin/kdb5_util dump /var/lib/krb5kdc/dump && /usr/sbin/kprop -r EXAMPLE.COM -f /var/lib/krb5kdc/dump kdc02.example.com
```

Finally, start the `krb5-kdc` daemon on the **secondary KDC**:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start krb5-kdc.service
```

> **Note**:
> The secondary KDC does not run an admin server, since it's a read-only copy.

From now on, you can specify both KDC servers in `/etc/krb5.conf` for the `EXAMPLE.COM` realm, in any host participating in this realm (including `kdc01` and `kdc02`), but remember that there can only be one admin server and that's the one running on `kdc01`:

```text
[realms]
    EXAMPLE.COM = {
            kdc = kdc01.example.com
            kdc = kdc02.example.com
            admin_server = kdc01.example.com
    }
```

The **secondary KDC** should now be able to issue tickets for the realm. You can test this by stopping the `krb5-kdc` daemon on the primary KDC, then using `kinit` to request a ticket. If all goes well you should receive a ticket from the secondary KDC. Otherwise, check `/var/log/syslog` and `/var/log/auth.log` on the secondary KDC.
