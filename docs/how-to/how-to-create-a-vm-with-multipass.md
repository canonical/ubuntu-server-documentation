# How to create a VM with Multipass


[Multipass](https://multipass.run) is the recommended method for creating Ubuntu VMs on Ubuntu. It's designed for developers who want a fresh Ubuntu environment with a single command, and it works on Linux, Windows and macOS.

On Linux it's available as a snap:

```bash
sudo snap install multipass
```

If you're running an older version of Ubuntu where `snapd` isn't pre-installed, you will need to install it first:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
```

## Find available images

To find available images you can use the `multipass find` command, which will produce a list like this:

```text
Image                       Aliases           Version          Description

## Launch a fresh instance of the Ubuntu Jammy (22.04) LTS

You can launch a fresh instance by specifying either the image name from the list (in this example, 22.04) or using an alias, if the image has one. 

```bash
$ multipass launch 22.04
Launched: cleansing-guanaco
```

This command is equivalent to: `multipass launch jammy` or `multipass launch lts` in the list above. It will launch an instance based on the specified image, and provide it with a random name -- in this case, `cleansing-guanaco`.

## Check out the running instances

You can check out the currently running instance(s) by using the "multipass list` command:

```bash
$ multipass list                                                  
Name                    State             IPv4             Image
cleansing-guanaco       Running           10.140.26.17     Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
```

## Learn more about the VM instance you just launched

You can use the `multipass info` command to find out more details about the VM instance parameters:

```bash
$ multipass info cleansing-guanaco 
Name:           cleansing-guanaco
State:          Running
IPv4:           10.140.26.17
Release:        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
Image hash:     dc5b5a43c267 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
Load:           0.45 0.19 0.07
Disk usage:     1.4G out of 4.7G
Memory usage:   168.3M out of 969.5M
Mounts:         --
```

## Connect to a running instance

To enter the VM you created, use the `shell` command:

```bash
$ multipass shell cleansing-guanaco 
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-53-generic x86_64)
(...)
ubuntu@cleansing-guanaco:~$ 
```

### Disconnect from the instance

Don't forget to log out (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>) when you are done, or you may find yourself heading all the way down the Inception levels...

## Run commands inside an instance from outside

```bash
$ multipass exec cleansing-guanaco -- lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu
Description:	Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
Release:	22.04
Codename:	jammy
```

## Stop or start an instance

You can stop an instance to save resources using the `stop` command:

```bash
$ multipass stop cleansing-guanaco
```

You can start it back up again using the `start` command:

```bash
$ multipass start cleansing-guanaco
```

## Delete the instance

Once you are finished with the instance, you can delete it as follows:

```bash
$ multipass delete cleansing-guanaco
```

It will now show up as deleted when you use the `list` command:

```bash
$ multipass list
Name                    State             IPv4             Image
cleansing-guanaco       Deleted           --               Not Available
```

And when you want to completely get rid of it (and any other deleted instances), you can use the `purge` command:

```bash
$ multipass purge
```

Which we can check again using `list`:

```bash
$ multipass list
No instances found.
```

## Integrate with the rest of your virtualization

You might have other virtualization already based on libvirt, either through using the similar older [uvtool](create-cloud-image-vms-with-uvtool.md) or through the more common [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/).

You might, for example, want those guests to be on the same bridge to communicate with each other, or if you need access to the graphical output for some reason.

Fortunately it is possible to integrate this by using the [libvirt](libvirt.md) backend of Multipass:

```bash
$ sudo multipass set local.driver=libvirt
```

Now when you start a guest you can also access it via tools like [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) or `virsh`:

```bash
$ multipass launch lts
Launched: engaged-amberjack 

$ virsh list
 Id    Name                           State
----------------------------------------------------
 15    engaged-amberjack              running
```

For more detailed and comprehensive instructions on changing your drivers, refer to the [Multipass drivers documentation](https://multipass.run/docs/set-up-the-driver).

## Get help

You can use the following commands on the CLI:

```bash
multipass help
multipass help <command>
multipass help --all
```

Or, check out the [Multipass documentation](https://multipass.run/docs) for more details on how to use it.
