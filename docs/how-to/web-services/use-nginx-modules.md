# How to use nginx modules

Like other web servers, nginx supports dynamically loaded modules to provide in-server support for programming languages, security mechanisms, and so on. Ubuntu provides a number of these modules as separate packages that are either installed simultaneously with nginx, or can be installed separately. 

## Available modules

nginx will report the modules it has been built with via its `-V` option.  A quick and dirty way to list the available modules is thus:

```bash
$ nginx -V 2>&1 | tr -- - '\n' | grep _module                                                                    
http_ssl_module                                                                                                  
http_stub_status_module                                                                                          
http_realip_module                                                                                               
...                                                                                                              
http_image_filter_module=dynamic                                                                                 
http_perl_module=dynamic                                                                                         
http_xslt_module=dynamic                                                                                         
stream_geoip_module=dynamic
```

Many of these modules are built-in and thus are always available with nginx, but some exist as separate packages whose installation status can be checked via `apt`. For example:

```bash
$ apt policy libnginx-mod-http-image-filter                                                                      
libnginx-mod-http-image-filter:                                                                                  
  Installed: (none)                                                                                              
  Candidate: 1.24.0-1ubuntu1                                                                                     
  Version table:                                                                                                 
     1.24.0-1ubuntu1 500                                                                                         
        500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu mantic/main amd64 Packages
```

`apt` can also be used to install the desired dynamic module:

```bash
$ sudo apt install libnginx-mod-http-image-filter                                                                
...                                                                                                              
The following NEW packages will be installed:                                                                    
  libnginx-mod-http-image-filter

...                                                                                                              
Triggering nginx reload                                                                                          
...
```

## Enabling and disabling dynamic modules

Dynamic modules are automatically enabled and get reloaded by nginx on installation. If you need to manually disable an installed module, remove its file from the `/etc/nginx/modules-enabled` directory, for example:

```bash
$ ls /etc/nginx/modules-*                                                                                        
/etc/nginx/modules-available:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                     
/etc/nginx/modules-enabled:                                                                                      
50-mod-http-image-filter.conf

$ sudo mv /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/50-mod-http-image-filter.conf /etc/nginx/modules-available/

$ service nginx restart
```

Note that built-in modules cannot be disabled/enabled.

## Configuring modules

The installed configuration file for an nginx module mainly consists of the dynamically-loaded binary library:

```text
## /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/50-mod-http-image-filter.conf
load_module modules/ngx_http_image_filter_module.so;
```

Note that you can also use the `load_module` parameter in your `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` at the top level, if preferred for some reason.

To use a module for your website, its settings are specified in your server block. For example:

```text
location /img/ {
    image_filter resize 240 360;
    image_filter rotate 180;
    image_filter_buffer 16M;
    error_page   415 = /415.html;
}
```
