# How to install and use Puppet

Puppet is a cross-platform framework for system administrators to perform common tasks using code.

The code can perform a variety of tasks, from installing new software, to checking file permissions, to updating user accounts. Puppet is used from the initial installation of a system and throughout the system's life cycle. In most circumstances, Puppet will be used in a client/server configuration.

This page will demonstrate how to install and configure Puppet in a client/server configuration, with the simple example of installing Apache using Puppet.

## Pre-configuration

Before configuring Puppet, you may want to add a DNS `CNAME` record for `puppet.example.com`, where `example.com` is your domain.

By default, Puppet clients check DNS for `puppet.example.com` as the puppet server name, or **Puppet Master**. See [Domain Name Server](domain-name-service-dns.md) for more details.

If you do not want to use DNS, you can add entries to the server and client `/etc/hosts` file. For example, in the Puppet server's `/etc/hosts` file add:

```text
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost puppet
192.168.1.17 puppetclient.example.com puppetclient
```

On each Puppet client, add an entry for the server:

```text
192.168.1.16 puppetmaster.example.com puppetmaster puppet
```

> **Note**:
> Replace the example IP addresses and domain names above with your actual server and client addresses and domain names.

## Install Puppet

To install Puppet, run the following command in a terminal on the **server**:

```bash
sudo apt install puppetmaster
```

On the **client** machine, or machines, enter:

```bash
sudo apt install puppet
```

## Configure Puppet

Create a folder path for the Apache2 class:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppet/modules/apache2/manifests
```

Now setup some resources for Apache2. Create a file `/etc/puppet/modules/apache2/manifests/init.pp` containing the following:

```
class apache2 {
  package { 'apache2':
    ensure => installed,
  }

  service { 'apache2':
    ensure  => true,
    enable  => true,
    require => Package['apache2'],
  }
}
```

Next, create a node file `/etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp` with:

```
node 'puppetclient.example.com' {
   include apache2
}
```

> **Note**:
> Replace `puppetclient.example.com` with your Puppet client's host name.

The final step for this simple Puppet server is to restart the daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart puppetmaster.service
```

Now everything is configured on the Puppet server, it is time to configure the client.

First, configure the Puppet agent daemon to start. Edit `/etc/default/puppet`, changing `START` to `yes`:

```
START=yes
```

Then start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start puppet.service
```

View the client cert fingerprint:

```bash
sudo puppet agent --fingerprint
```

Back on the Puppet server, view pending certificate signing requests:

```bash
sudo puppet cert list
```

On the Puppet server, verify the fingerprint of the client and sign the `puppetclient` cert:

```bash
sudo puppet cert sign puppetclient.example.com
```

On the Puppet client, run the puppet agent manually in the foreground. This step isn't strictly necessary, but it is the best way to test and debug the puppet service.

```bash
sudo puppet agent --test
```

Check `/var/log/syslog` on both hosts for any errors with the configuration. If all goes well the Apache2 package and it's dependencies will be installed on the Puppet client.
