Ubuntu Server how-to guides
***************************

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Server, our
how-to guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied
to a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but
may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific
requirements.

Server installation
===================

The following installation guides are more advanced than our getting started
tutorial, but can be applied to specific scenarios. If you are looking for a
more straightforward installation, refer to our
:ref:`basic installation <basic-installation>` tutorial.

**The Server installer**

The Ubuntu installer now has its own documentation for automatic (or
"hands-off" installations). For more guidance on auto-installing Ubuntu with
the installer, refer to these guides from the Ubuntu installer documentation
(note: these pages will redirect you outside of the Server documentation).
