# Introduction to security

Security should always be considered when installing, deploying, and using any type of computer system. Although a fresh installation of Ubuntu is relatively safe for immediate use on the Internet, it is important to have a balanced understanding of your system's security posture based on how it will be used after deployment.

This chapter provides an overview of security-related topics as they pertain to Ubuntu Server Edition, and outlines simple measures you may use to protect your server and network from any number of potential security threats.
