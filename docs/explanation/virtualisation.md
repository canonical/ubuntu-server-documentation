## Virtualization

* {ref}`VM tools overview <vm-tools-in-the-ubuntu-space>` gives more details about the virtual machines available in Ubuntu

We also give further details on some specific usage scenarios here:

* {ref}`QEMU microvm <qemu-microvm>`
* {ref}`Upgrading the machine type of your VM <upgrading-the-machine-type-of-your-vm>`

## Containers

* {ref}`Container tools overview <container-tools-in-the-ubuntu-space>` gives more details about the popular container technologies available in Ubuntu

There are more detailed discussions on specific technologies here:

* {ref}`About rock images <about-rock-images>`
* {ref}`Docker storage, networking, and logging <docker-storage-networking-and-logging>`
