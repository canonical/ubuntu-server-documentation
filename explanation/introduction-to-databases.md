# Introduction to databases


Ubuntu provides two popular database servers. They are:

  - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Both are popular choices among developers, with similar feature sets and performance capabilities. Historically, Postgres tended to be a preferred choice for its attention to standards conformance, features, and extensibility, whereas MySQL may be more preferred for higher performance requirements. However, over time each has made good strides catching up with the other. Specialised needs may make one a better option for a certain application, but in general both are good, strong options.

They are available in the Main repository and equally supported by Ubuntu. This section explains how to install and configure these database servers.
