Virtualization
==============

* :ref:`VM tools overview <vm-tools-in-the-ubuntu-space>` gives more details
  about the virtual machines available in Ubuntu

We also give further details on some specific usage scenarios here:

* :ref:`QEMU microvm <qemu-microvm>`
* :ref:`Upgrading the machine type of your VM <upgrading-the-machine-type-of-your-vm>`

Containers
==========

* :ref:`Container tools overview <container-tools-in-the-ubuntu-space>` gives
  more details about the popular container technologies available in Ubuntu

There are more detailed discussions on specific technologies here:

* :ref:`About rock images <about-rock-images>`
