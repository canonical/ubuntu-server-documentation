# Multipath configuration examples

Before moving on with this section we suggesting reading or being familiar with the topics covered in:

1. {ref}`Introduction to device mapper multipathing <introduction-to-multipath>`
2. {ref}`Configuration options and overview <configuring-multipath>`

For consistency with those sections, we will refer here to device mapper multipathing as **multipath**.

## Basic setup

Before setting up multipath on your system, ensure that your system has been updated and includes the `multipath-tools` package. If you want to boot from the storage area network (SAN), then the `multipath-tools-boot` package is also required.

A very simple `/etc/multipath.conf` file exists, as explained in {ref}`the configuration overview <configuring-multipath>`. All attributes not declared in `multipath.conf` are taken from the `multipath-tools` internal database and its internal blacklist.

The **internal attributes** database can be acquired by running the following on the command line:

```bash
sudo multipath -t
```

Multipath usually works out-of-the-box with most common storages. This **does not mean** the default configuration variables should be used in production: the default variables donâ€™t treat important parameters your storage might need.

With the internal attributes (described above), and the example below, you will likely be able to create your `/etc/multipath.conf` file by squashing the code blocks below. Make sure to read the `defaults` section attribute comments and make any changes based on what your environment needs.

### Example of a defaults section

### Example of a multipaths section

```{note}
You can obtain the WWIDs for your LUNs by running: `multipath -ll`
after the service `multipath-tools.service` has been restarted.
```

```
