# About time synchronisation

Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for synchronising time over a network. Basically, a client requests the current time from a server, and uses it to set its own clock.

Behind this simple description, there is a lot of complexity. There are three tiers of NTP servers; tier one NTP servers are connected to atomic clocks, while tier two and tier three three servers spread the load of actually handling requests across the Internet.

The client software is also a lot more complex than you might expect. It must factor in communication delays and adjust the time in a way that does not upset all the other processes that run on the server. Luckily, all that complexity is hidden from you\!

By default, Ubuntu uses `chrony` to synchronise time, which is installed by default. See our guides, if you would like to know how to {ref}`synchronise time with Chrony <chrony-client>` or {ref}`use chrony to serve NTP <serve-ntp-with-chrony>`.

Users can optionally use {ref}`timedatectl and timesyncd <timedatectl-and-timesyncd>`.

## How time synchronisation works

Since Ubuntu 25.10, `chrony` replaces most of `systemd-timesyncd` but still uses systemd's `timedatectl`.

### About `chrony`

`chrony` replaces not only `ntpdate`, but also the Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) client of `timesyncd` (formerly `ntpd`). So, on top of the one-shot action that `ntpdate` provided on boot and network activation, `chrony` now regularly checks and keeps your local time in sync. It also stores time updates locally, so that after reboots the time monotonically advances (if applicable).

### About `timedatectl`

If `chrony` is installed, `timedatectl` can still be used to configure basic settings, such as setting the timezone. But more complex configuration needs to be set up using the `chronyc` command. This ensures that no two time-syncing services can conflict with each other.

`ntpdate` is now considered deprecated in favor of `chrony` (or `timesyncd`) and is no longer installed by default. `chrony` will generally keep your time in sync and can be set up as a time server, `timesyncd` can help with simpler cases. But if you had one of a few known special `ntpdate` use cases, consider the following:

  - If you require a one-shot sync, use: `chronyd -q`
  - If you require a one-shot time check (without setting the time), use: `chronyd -Q`

While use of `ntpd` is no longer recommended, this also still applies to `ntpd` being installed to retain any previous behaviour/config that you had through an upgrade. However, it also implies that on an upgrade from a former release, `ntp`/`ntpdate` might still be installed and therefore renders the new `systemd`-based services disabled.
