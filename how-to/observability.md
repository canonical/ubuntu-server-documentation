# Observability

In Ubuntu, it is recommended to use the [Canonical Observability Stack](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/observability/) to monitor your infrastructure.

However, you can also use the classic Logging, Monitoring and Alerting (LMA) stack.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:

Set up your LMA stack <observability/set-up-your-lma-stack>
```

If you do not need a full LMA stack, there are some other supported tools that can provide similar capabilities.

```{toctree}
:titlesonly:

Install Logwatch <observability/install-logwatch>
Install Munin <observability/install-munin>
Install Nagios Core 3 <observability/install-nagios>
Use Nagios with Munin <observability/use-nagios-with-munin>
```
