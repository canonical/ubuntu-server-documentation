Networking
**********

This section contains how-to guides on most aspects of networking in Ubuntu.
If you would like a broader overview of these topics before getting started,
refer to our :ref:`introduction to networking <introduction-to-networking>`.

Configuration
=============

Network configuration in Ubuntu is handled through Netplan. See our general
walkthrough on :ref:`configuring-networks`, or refer to
`the Netplan documentation <https://netplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for
more specific instructions.

Network tools
=============

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) can be set up to provide files for download.

The Domain Name Service (DNS) maps IP addresses to fully qualified domain names
(FQDN). The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) allow DNS data to be verified.

   Set up a name server (DNS) <networking/install-dns>
   Set up DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) <networking/install-dnssec>
   DNSSEC Troubleshooting <networking/dnssec-troubleshooting>

Open vSwitch (OVS) with the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) provides virtual
switching for network automation in virtualized environments.

DHCP
====

Set up Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for automatic IP address
assignment for devices on your network. There are two DHCP servers available in
Ubuntu: ``isc-kea`` is the most modern, and is available from 23.04 onwards.

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   Install DHCP isc-kea <networking/install-isc-kea>
   Install DHCP isc-dhcp-server <networking/install-isc-dhcp-server>

Time synchronisation
====================

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) synchronizes time over a network. Ubuntu uses
``timedatectl`` and ``timesyncd`` by default to handle this. However, users can
install and use ``chrony`` instead if preferred.

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   Time sync with timedatectl and timesyncd <networking/timedatectl-and-timesyncd>
   Time sync with chrony <networking/serve-ntp-with-chrony>

Network shares
==============

Sharing files and resources across a network is a common requirement - this is
where the Network File System (NFS) comes in.

If you need to share network resources between Linux and Windows systems, see
our sections on Samba and Active Directory.

   Active Directory integration <active-directory>

* :ref:`Active Directory integration <how-to-active-directory-integration>`

Printing
========

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) is the most common way to manage print
services in Ubuntu.

   Set up a CUPS print server <networking/cups-print-server>
