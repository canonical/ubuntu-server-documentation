Observability
**************

In Ubuntu, it is recommended to use the
`Canonical Observability Stack <https://charmhub.io/topics/canonical-observability-stack>`_
to monitor your infrastructure.

However, you can also use the classic Logging, Monitoring and Alerting (LMA)
stack.

If you do not need a full LMA stack, there are some other supported tools that
can provide similar capabilities.
