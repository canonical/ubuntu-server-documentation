# How to set up SSSD with LDAP

SSSD can also use LDAP for authentication, authorisation, and user/group information. In this section we will configure a host to authenticate users from an OpenLDAP directory.

## Prerequisites and assumptions

For this setup, we need:

  - An existing OpenLDAP server with SSL enabled and using the RFC2307 schema for users and groups
  - A client host where we will install the necessary tools and login as a user from the LDAP server

## Install necessary software

Install the following packages:

```bash
sudo apt install sssd-ldap ldap-utils
```

## Configure SSSD

Create the `/etc/sssd/sssd.conf` configuration file, with permissions `0600` and ownership `root:root`, and add the following content:

```text
[sssd]
config_file_version = 2
domains = example.com

[domain/example.com]
id_provider = ldap
auth_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://ldap01.example.com
cache_credentials = True
ldap_search_base = dc=example,dc=com
```

Make sure to start the `sssd` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start sssd.service
```

> **Note**:
> `sssd` will use `START_TLS` by default for authentication requests against the LDAP server (the **`auth_provider`**), but not for the **`id_provider`**. If you want to also enable `START_TLS` for the `id_provider`, specify `ldap_id_use_start_tls = true`.

## Automatic home directory creation

To enable automatic home directory creation, run the following command:

```bash
sudo pam-auth-update --enable mkhomedir
```

## Check SSL setup on the client

The client must be able to use `START_TLS` when connecting to the LDAP server, with full certificate checking. This means:

- The client host knows and trusts the CA that signed the LDAP server certificate,
- The server certificate was issued for the correct host (`ldap01.example.com` in this guide),
- The time is correct on all hosts performing the TLS connection, and
- That neither certificate (CA or server's) expired.

If using a custom CA, an easy way to have a host trust it is to place it in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` with a `.crt` extension and run `sudo update-ca-certificates`.

Alternatively, you can edit `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf` and point `TLS_CACERT` to the CA public key file.

> **Note**:
> You may have to restart `sssd` after these changes: `sudo systemctl restart sssd`

Once that is all done, check that you can connect to the LDAP server using verified SSL connections:

```bash
$ ldapwhoami -x -ZZ -H ldap://ldap01.example.com
anonymous
```

and for `ldaps` (if enabled in `/etc/default/slapd`):

```bash
$ ldapwhoami -x -H ldaps://ldap01.example.com
```

The `-ZZ` parameter tells the tool to use `START_TLS`, and that it must not fail. If you have LDAP logging enabled on the server, it will show something like this:

```
slapd[779]: conn=1032 op=0 STARTTLS
slapd[779]: conn=1032 op=0 RESULT oid= err=0 text=
slapd[779]: conn=1032 fd=15 TLS established tls_ssf=256 ssf=256
slapd[779]: conn=1032 op=1 BIND dn="" method=128
slapd[779]: conn=1032 op=1 RESULT tag=97 err=0 text=
slapd[779]: conn=1032 op=2 EXT oid=1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3
slapd[779]: conn=1032 op=2 WHOAMI
slapd[779]: conn=1032 op=2 RESULT oid= err=0 text=
```

`START_TLS` with `err=0` and `TLS established` is what we want to see there, and, of course, the `WHOAMI` extended operation.

## Final verification

In this example, the LDAP server has the following user and group entry we are going to use for testing:

```
dn: uid=john,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
uid: john
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
cn: John Smith
sn: Smith
givenName: John
mail: john@example.com
userPassword: johnsecret
uidNumber: 10001
gidNumber: 10001
loginShell: /bin/bash
homeDirectory: /home/john

dn: cn=john,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
cn: john
objectClass: posixGroup
gidNumber: 10001
memberUid: john

dn: cn=Engineering,ou=Group,dc=example,dc=com
cn: Engineering
objectClass: posixGroup
gidNumber: 10100
memberUid: john
```

The user `john` should be known to the system:

```bash
ubuntu@ldap-client:~$ getent passwd john
john:*:10001:10001:John Smith:/home/john:/bin/bash

ubuntu@ldap-client:~$ id john
uid=10001(john) gid=10001(john) groups=10001(john),10100(Engineering)
```

And we should be able to authenticate as `john`:

```bash
ubuntu@ldap-client:~$ sudo login
ldap-client login: john
Password:
Welcome to Ubuntu Focal Fossa (development branch) (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-24-generic x86_64)
(...)
Creating directory '/home/john'.
john@ldap-client:~$
```
