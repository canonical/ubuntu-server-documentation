# Non-interactive IBM z/VM autoinstall (s390x)


This non-interactive installation uses 'autoinstall', which can be considered the successor to the Debian installer (d-i) and preseed on Ubuntu. This is a detailed step-by-step guide, including output and logs (which are partially a bit shortened, as indicated by '...', to limit the size of this document).

The example z/VM guest here uses a direct-access storage device ({term}`DASD`) and is connected to a regular (non-VLAN) network.

For a zFCP and a VLAN network example, please see the [non-interactive IBM LPAR (s390x) installation using autoinstall](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/non-interactive-ibm-z-lpar-s390x-installation-using-autoinstall/16988) guide.

* Start with the preparation of the (FTP) install server (if it doesn't already exist).

  ```bash
  user@local:~$ ssh admin@installserver.local
  admin@installserver:~$ mkdir -p /srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04
  admin@installserver:~$ wget http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-server/focal/daily-live/current/focal-live-server-s390x.iso --directory-prefix=/srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04

  admin@installserver:~$
  ```

* The ISO image needs to be extracted now. Since files in the boot folder need to be modified, loopback mount is not an option here:

  ```bash
  admin@installserver:~$ cd /srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04
  admin@installserver:/srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04$ mkdir iso
  admin@installserver:/srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04$ sudo mount -o loop ./focal-live-server-s390x.iso ./iso
  [sudo] password for admin: 
  mount: /home/user/iso-test/iso: WARNING: device write-protected, mounted read-only.
  admin@installserver:/srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04$ ls -l
  total 684530
  -rw-rw-r--  1 user user 700952576 Jun 26 10:12 focal-live-server-s390x.iso
  dr-xr-xr-x 10 root    root         2048 Jun 26 10:12 iso
  admin@installserver:/srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04$
  ```

* Now make sure an FTP server is running in the *installserver* with `/srv/ftp` as ftp-server root (as used in this example).

* Next, prepare an *autoinstall* (HTTP) server. This hosts the configuration data for the non-interactive installation.

  ```bash
  admin@installserver:/srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04$ mkdir -p /srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest
  admin@installserver:/srv/ftp/ubuntu-daily-live-server-20.04$ cd /srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest
  admin@installserver:/srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest$ 
  admin@installserver:/srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest$ echo "instance-id: $(uuidgen || openssl rand -base64 8)" > meta-data
  admin@installserver:/srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest$ cat meta-data
  instance-id: 2c2215fb-6a38-417f-b72f-376b1cc44f01
  admin@installserver:/srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest$
  ```
  ```bash
  admin@installserver:/srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest$ vi user-data
  admin@installserver:/srv/www/autoinstall/zvmguest$ cat user-data

        allow-pw: true
        authorized-keys: ['ssh-rsa  meQwtZ user@workstation # ssh-import-id lp:user']
    admin@installserver:~$
  ```

* For s390x installations, the `early-commands` section is the interesting part:

  ```bash
  early-commands:
    - touch /tmp/lets_activate_the_s390x_devices
    - chzdev dasd -e 1f00
    - touch /tmp/s390x_devices_activation_done
  ```

  The first and last `early-commands` are optional; they only frame and indicate the real s390x command activation.

  In this particular example a single {term}`DASD` {term}`ECKD` disk with the address `1f00` is enabled. zFCP disk storage can be enabled via their host (host-bus-adapters) addresses, for example *e000* (`chzdev zfcp -e e000`) and *e100* (`chzdev zfcp -e e000`). These have certain Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) assigned, which are all automatically discovered and activated by `chzdev zfcp-lun -e --online`. Activation of a qeth device would look like this: `chzdev qeth -e 0600`.

* For more details about the autoinstall config options, please have a look at the [autoinstall reference](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/install/autoinstall-reference) and [autoinstall schema](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/install/autoinstall-schema) page.

* Now make sure a HTTP server is running with `/srv/www` as web-server root (in this particular example).

* Log in to your z/VM system using your preferred 3270 client -- for example x3270 or c3270.

* Transfer the installer kernel, initrd, parmfile and exec file to the z/VM system that is used for the installation. Put these files (for example) on File Mode (Fm) *A* (a.k.a disk *A*):

  ```
  listfiles
  UBUNTU    EXEC     A1
  KERNEL    UBUNTU   A1
  INITRD    UBUNTU   A1
  PARMFILE  UBUNTU   A1
  ```
* Now specify the necessary autoinstall parameters in the parmfile:

  ```
  xedit PARMFILE  UBUNTU   A
   PARMFILE UBUNTU   O1  F 80  Trunc=80 Size=3 Line=0 Col=1 Alt=0
  00000 * * * Top of File * * *
  00001 ip=10.11.12.23::10.11.12.1:255.255.255.0:zvmguest:enc600:none:10.11.12.1

  00004 /autoinstall/zvmguest/ --- quiet                            
  00005 * * * End of File * * * 
  ```

> **Note**: 
> In case of any issues hitting the 80-character-per-line limit of the file, you can write parameters across two lines as long as there are no unwanted white spaces. To view all 80 characters in one line, disable the prefix area on the left. "prefix off | on" will be  your friend -- use it in the command area. 

* You can now start the z/VM installation by executing the `UBUNTU REXX` script with `UBUNTU`.

* Now monitor the initial program load (IPL) -- a.k.a. the boot-up process -- of the install system. This is quite crucial, because during this process a temporary installation password is generated and displayed. The line(s) look similar to this:

  ```
  ...
  |37.487141| cloud-init¬1873|: Set the following 'random' passwords
  |37.487176| cloud-init¬1873|: installer: **i7UFdP8fhiVVMme3qqH8**
  ...
  ```

  This password is needed for remotely connecting to the installer via SSH in the next step.

* So, start the `REXX` script:

  ```

## Some closing notes

  * It's always best to use the latest installer and autoinstall components: either make sure the installer gets updated to the latest level, or just use a current daily live-server image.

  * The ISO image specified with the kernel parameters needs to fit in the boot folder. Its kernel and initrd are specified in the 'Load from Removable Media and Server' task at the hardware management console (HMC).

  * In addition to activating disk storage resources in `early-commands`, other devices like OSA/qeth can be added and activated there, too. This is not needed for the basic network device, as specified in the kernel parameters that are used for the installation (that one is automatically handled).

  * If everything is properly set up -- FTP server for the image, HTTP server for the autoinstall config files -- the installation can be as quick as 2 to 3 minutes (depending on the complexity of the autoinstall YAML file).

  * There is a simple way of generating a sample autoinstall YAML file: one can perform an interactive Subiquity installation, grab the file `/var/log/installer/autoinstall-user-data`, and use it as an example -- but beware that the `early-commands` entries to activate the s390x-specific devices need to be added manually!
