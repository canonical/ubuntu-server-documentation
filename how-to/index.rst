Ubuntu Server how-to guides
***************************

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Server, our
how-to guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied
to a broader set of applications. Theyâ€™ll help you achieve an end result but
may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific
requirements.
