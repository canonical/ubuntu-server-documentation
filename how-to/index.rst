Ubuntu Server how-to guides
***************************

If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with Ubuntu Server, our
how-to guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied
to a broader set of applications. They’ll help you achieve an end result but
may require you to understand and adapt the steps to fit your specific
requirements.

Server installation
===================

Our list of :ref:`installation guides <how-to-server-installation>` contains
installation instructions for a variety of architecture-specific and advanced
setups. For a general installation, or if you're just getting started with
Ubuntu, you may prefer to use our :ref:`basic installation <basic-installation>`
tutorial.
