# Share access controls

There are several options available to control access for each individual shared directory. Using the *\[share\]* example, this section will cover some common options.

Since most of these options will deal with user authentication, we first need to briefly address how that is done in Samba.

## Authenticating Samba users

Samba cannot authenticate existing Linux users using the its native protocols. This is just not compatible with the way Linux passwords are stored in the system (in `/etc/shadow`, for example). All local Linux users that the system may have are not automatically available as Samba users. To have a local Linux user available as a Samba user, they need to be created in the Samba credentials database. That means we will have two user databases: the Linux one, and the Samba one.

```{seealso}
How to create and manage Linux users is covered in {ref}`Users and groups management <user-management>`.
```

To add an existing Linux user to the Samba user database, the command `smbpasswd` is used. For example, here we are adding an existing Linux user called `melissa` to the Samba user database:
```text
sudo smbpasswd -a melissa
```
The command will prompt for a password twice, for confirmation, and create the Samba user.
```{note}
As this is a separate user database, the password selected for the Samba user does not need to be the same as the Linux password for that user. In fact, most Samba servers setup this way will have the Linux users setup without a valid password: these users only exist so that the corresponding Samba users can be created.
```

If this user does not exist in Linux, the `smbpasswd` command will fail. Samba users must first exist as Linux users.

To later change the password of an existing Samba user, the same command is used. For example:
```text
sudo smbpasswd melissa
```

Samba also has the concept of Samba groups, but since there is no authentication going on, there is no need to create a separate group database just for Samba groups. We can use the normal Linux group, as long as the group members (the users) exist both in the Linux and Samba user database.

## Groups

*Groups* define a collection of users who have a common level of access to particular network resources. This provides granularity in controlling access to such resources. For example, let's consider a group called "qa" is defined to contain the users *Freda*, *Danika*, and *Rob*,  and then a group called "support" is created containing the users *Danika*, *Jeremy*, and *Vincent*. Any network resources configured to allow access by the "qa" group will be available to Freda, Danika, and Rob, but not Jeremy or Vincent. Danika can access resources available to both groups since she belongs to both the "qa" and "support" groups. All other users only have access to resources explicitly allowed to the group they are part of.

When mentioning groups in the Samba configuration file, `/etc/samba/smb.conf`, the recognized syntax is to preface the group name with an "@" symbol. For example, if you wished to use a group named *sysadmin* in a certain section of the `/etc/samba/smb.conf`, you would do so by entering the group name as `@sysadmin`. If a group name has a space in it, use double quotes, like `"@LTS Releases"`.

## Read and write permissions

Read and write permissions define the explicit rights a computer or user has to a particular share. Such permissions may be defined by editing the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file and specifying the explicit permissions inside a share.

For example, if you have defined a Samba share called *share* and wish to give read-only permissions to the group of users known as "qa", but wanted to allow writing to the share by the group called "sysadmin" *and* the user named "vincent", then you could edit the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file and add the following entries under the *\[share\]* entry:

```text 
read list = @qa
write list = @sysadmin, vincent
```

Another possible Samba permission is to declare *administrative* permissions to a particular shared resource. Users having administrative permissions may read, write, or modify any information contained in the resource the user has been given explicit administrative permissions to.

For example, if you wanted to give the user *Melissa* administrative permissions to the *share* example, you would edit the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file, and add the following line under the *\[share\]* entry:

```text 
admin users = melissa
```

```{note}
Remember that the users listed in `smb.conf` for these access controls need to exist both as Linux users, and Samba users.
```
After editing `/etc/samba/smb.conf`, reload Samba for the changes to take effect by running the following command:

```bash
sudo smbcontrol smbd reload-config
```

## Filesystem permissions

Now that Samba has been configured to limit which groups have access to the shared directory, the {term}`filesystem` permissions need to be checked.

Traditional Linux file permissions do not map well to Windows NT Access Control Lists ({term}`ACL`s). Fortunately POSIX ACLs are available on Ubuntu servers, which provides more fine-grained control. For example, to enable ACLs on `/srv` in an EXT3 filesystem, edit `/etc/fstab` and add the *acl* option:

```text
UUID=66bcdd2e-8861-4fb0-b7e4-e61c569fe17d /srv  ext3    noatime,relatime,acl 0       1
```

Then remount the partition:

```bash
sudo mount -v -o remount /srv
```

```{note}
This example assumes `/srv` is on a separate partition. If `/srv`, or wherever you have configured your share path, is part of the `/` partition then a reboot may be required.
```

To match the Samba configuration above, the "sysadmin" group will be given read, write, and execute permissions to `/srv/samba/share`, the "qa" group will be given read and execute permissions, and the files will be owned by the username "Melissa". Enter the following in a terminal:

```bash
sudo chown -R melissa /srv/samba/share/
sudo chgrp -R sysadmin /srv/samba/share/
sudo setfacl -R -m g:qa:rx /srv/samba/share/
```

```{note}
The `setfacl` command above gives *execute* permissions to all files in the `/srv/samba/share` directory, which you may or may not want.
```

Now from a Windows client you should notice the new file permissions are implemented. See the {manpage}`acl(5)` and {manpage}`setfacl(1)` manual pages for more information on POSIX ACLs.
