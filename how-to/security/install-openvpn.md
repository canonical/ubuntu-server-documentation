# How to install and use OpenVPN

OpenVPN is a flexible, reliable and secure Virtual Private Networking (VPN) solution. It belongs to the family of SSL/TLS VPN stacks (different from IPSec VPNs). This chapter will show how to install and configure OpenVPN to create a VPN.

## Install the server

To install OpenVPN, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa
```

## Set up the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

If you want more than just pre-shared keys, OpenVPN makes it easy to set up a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to use SSL/TLS certificates for authentication and key exchange between the VPN server and clients.

OpenVPN can be used in a routed or bridged VPN mode and can be configured to use either UDP or TCP. The port number can be configured as well, but port 1194 is the official one; this single port is used for all communication. {ref}`VPN client implementations <openvpn-client-implementations>` are available for almost anything including all Linux distributions, macOS, Windows and OpenWRT-based WLAN routers.

The first step in building an OpenVPN configuration is to establish a PKI, which consists of:

- A separate certificate (also known as a public key) and private key for the server and each client

- A primary Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and key, used to sign the server and client certificates

OpenVPN supports bi-directional authentication based on certificates, meaning that the client must authenticate the server certificate and the server must authenticate the client certificate before mutual trust is established.

Both the server and the client will authenticate each other by first verifying that the presented certificate was signed by the primary Certificate Authority (CA), and then by testing information in the now-authenticated certificate header, such as the certificate common name or certificate type (client or server).

### Set up the Certificate Authority

To set up your own CA, and generate certificates and keys for an OpenVPN server with multiple clients, first copy the `easy-rsa` directory to `/etc/openvpn`. This will ensure that any changes to the scripts will not be lost when the package is updated. From a terminal, run:

```bash
sudo make-cadir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
```

> **Note**:
> You can alternatively edit `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars` directly, adjusting it to your needs.

As a `root` user, change to the newly created directory `/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa` and run:

```bash
./easyrsa init-pki
./easyrsa build-ca
```

The PEM passphrase set when creating the CA will be asked for every time you need to encrypt the output of a command (such as a private key). The encryption here is important, to avoid printing any private key in plain text.

### Create server keys and certificates

Next, we will generate a key pair for the server:

```bash
./easyrsa gen-req myservername nopass
```

Diffie Hellman parameters must be generated for the OpenVPN server. The following command will place them in `pki/dh.pem`:

```bash
./easyrsa gen-dh
```

And finally, create a certificate for the server:

```bash
./easyrsa sign-req server myservername
```

All certificates and keys have been generated in subdirectories. Common practice is to copy them to `/etc/openvpn/`:

```bash
cp pki/dh.pem pki/ca.crt pki/issued/myservername.crt pki/private/myservername.key /etc/openvpn/
```

### Create client certificates

The VPN client will also need a certificate to authenticate itself to the server. Usually you create a different certificate for each client. 

This can be done either on the server (as with the keys and certificates above) and then securely distributed to the client, or the client can generate and submit a request that is sent and signed by the server.

To create the certificate, enter the following in a terminal as a root user:

```bash
./easyrsa gen-req myclient1 nopass
./easyrsa sign-req client myclient1
```

If the first command above was done on a remote system, then copy the `.req` file to the CA server. From there, you can import it via `easyrsa import-req /incoming/myclient1.req myclient1`. Then you can go on with the second `sign-eq` command.

After this is done, in both cases you will need to copy the following files to the client using a secure method:

- `pki/ca.crt`
- `pki/issued/myclient1.crt`

Since the client certificates and keys are only required on the client machine, you can remove them from the server.

## Simple server configuration

Included with your OpenVPN installation are these (and many more) sample configuration files:

```bash
root@server:/# ls -l /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/
total 68
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 3427 2011-07-04 15:09 client.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4141 2011-07-04 15:09 server.conf.gz
```

Start by copying and unpacking `server.conf.gz` to `/etc/openvpn/server.conf`:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz /etc/openvpn/myserver.conf.gz
sudo gzip -d /etc/openvpn/myserver.conf.gz
```

Edit `/etc/openvpn/myserver.conf` to make sure the following lines are pointing to the certificates and keys you created in the section above.

```
ca ca.crt
cert myservername.crt
key myservername.key
dh dh.pem
```

Complete this set with a TLS Authentication (TA) key in `etc/openvpn` for `tls-auth` like this:

```bash
sudo openvpn --genkey --secret ta.key
```

Edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and uncomment the following line to enable IP forwarding:

```
#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

Then reload `sysctl`:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
```

This is the minimum you need to configure to get a working OpenVPN server. You can use all the default settings in the sample `server.conf` file. Now you can start the server. 

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@myserver
```

> **Note**: 
> Be aware that the `systemctl start openvpn` is **not** starting the `openvpn` you just defined.
> OpenVPN uses templated `systemd` jobs, `openvpn@CONFIGFILENAME`. So if, for example, your configuration file is `myserver.conf` your service is called `openvpn@myserver`. You can run all kinds of service and `systemctl` commands like `start/stop/enable/disable/preset` against a templated service like `openvpn@server`.

You will find logging and error messages in the journal. For example, if you started a [templated service](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.unit.html) `openvpn@server` you can filter for this particular message source with:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u openvpn@myserver -xe
```

The same templated approach works for all of `systemctl`:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status openvpn@myserver
openvpn@myserver.service - OpenVPN connection to myserver

```

You can enable/disable various OpenVPN services on one system, but you could also let Ubuntu do it for you. There is a config for `AUTOSTART `in `/etc/default/openvpn`. Allowed values are "all", "none" or a space-separated list of names of the VPNs. If empty, "all" is assumed. The VPN name refers to the VPN configuration file name, i.e., `home` would be `/etc/openvpn/home.conf`.

If you're running `systemd`, changing this variable requires running `systemctl daemon-reload` followed by a restart of the `openvpn` service (if you removed entries you may have to stop those manually).

After `systemctl daemon-reload`, a restart of the "generic" OpenVPN will restart all dependent services that the generator in `/lib/systemd/system-generators/openvpn-generator` created for your `conf` files when you called `daemon-reload`.

Now, check if OpenVPN created a `tun0` interface:

```bash
root@server:/etc/openvpn# ip addr show dev tun0
5: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 100
    link/none 
    inet 10.8.0.1 peer 10.8.0.2/32 scope global tun0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::b5ac:7829:f31e:32c5/64 scope link stable-privacy 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

## Simple client configuration

There are various different OpenVPN client implementations -- both with and without GUIs. You can read more about clients in {ref}`our page on OpenVPN Clients <openvpn-client-implementations>`. For now, we use the command-line/service-based OpenVPN client for Ubuntu, which is part of the same package as the server. So you must install the `openvpn` package again on the client machine:

```bash
sudo apt install openvpn
```

This time, copy the `client.conf` sample config file to `/etc/openvpn/`:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/client.conf /etc/openvpn/
```

Copy the following client keys and certificate files you created in the section above to e.g. `/etc/openvpn/` and edit `/etc/openvpn/client.conf` to make sure the following lines are pointing to those files. If you have the files in `/etc/openvpn/` you can omit the path:

```text
ca ca.crt
cert myclient1.crt
key myclient1.key
tls-auth ta.key 1
```

And you have to specify the OpenVPN server name or address. Make sure the keyword **`client`** is in the config file, since that's what enables client mode.

```text
client
remote vpnserver.example.com 1194
```

Now start the OpenVPN client with the same templated mechanism:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@client
```

You can check the status as you did on the server:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status openvpn@client
openvpn@client.service - OpenVPN connection to client

```

And you can check on the client if it created a `tun0` interface:

```bash
$ ip addr show dev tun0
4: tun0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 100
    link/none

    inet6 fe80::5a94:ae12:8901:5a75/64 scope link stable-privacy 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Check if you can ping the OpenVPN server:

```bash
root@client:/etc/openvpn# ping 10.8.0.1
PING 10.8.0.1 (10.8.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.8.0.1: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.920 ms
```

> **Note**:
> The OpenVPN server always uses the first usable IP address in the client network and only that IP is pingable. E.g., if you configured a `/24` for the client network mask, the `.1` address will be used. The P-t-P address you see in the `ip addr` output above does not usually answer ping requests.

Check out your routes:

```bash
$ ip route 
default via 192.168.122.1 dev ens3 proto dhcp src 192.168.122.114 metric 100 
10.8.0.1 via 10.8.0.5 dev tun0 
10.8.0.5 dev tun0 proto kernel scope link src 10.8.0.6 
192.168.122.0/24 dev ens3 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.122.114 
192.168.122.1 dev ens3 proto dhcp scope link src 192.168.122.114 metric 100
```

## First troubleshooting

If the above didn't work for you, check the following:

- Check your `journal -xe`.
- Check that you have specified the key filenames correctly in the client and server `conf` files.
- Can the client connect to the server machine? Maybe a firewall is blocking access? Check the journal on the server.
- Client and server must use same protocol and port, e.g. UDP port 1194, see `port` and `proto` config options.
- Client and server must use the same compression configuration, see `comp-lzo` config option.
- Client and server must use same config regarding bridged vs. routed mode, see `server vs server-bridge` config option

## Advanced configuration

### Advanced routed VPN configuration on server

The above is a very simple working VPN. The client can access services on the VPN server machine through an encrypted tunnel. If you want to reach more servers or anything in other networks, push some routes to the clients. E.g. if your company's network can be summarised to the network `192.168.0.0/16`, you could push this route to the clients. But you will also have to change the routing for the way back -- your servers need to know a route to the VPN client-network.

The example config files that we have been using in this guide are full of these advanced options in the form of a comment and a disabled configuration line as an example.

> **Note**:
> Read the OpenVPN [hardening security guide](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#security) for further security advice.

### Advanced bridged VPN configuration on server

OpenVPN can be set up for either a routed or a bridged VPN mode. Sometimes this is also referred to as OSI layer-2 versus layer-3 VPN. In a bridged VPN all layer-2 frames -- e.g. all Ethernet frames -- are sent to the VPN partners and in a routed VPN only layer-3 packets are sent to VPN partners. In bridged mode, all traffic including traffic which was traditionally LAN-local (like local network broadcasts, {term}`DHCP` requests, ARP requests etc) are sent to VPN partners, whereas in routed mode this would be filtered.

#### Prepare interface config for bridging on server

First, use Netplan to configure a bridge device using the desired Ethernet device:

```bash
$ cat /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        enp0s31f6:
            dhcp4: no
    bridges:
        br0:
            interfaces: [enp0s31f6]
            dhcp4: no
            addresses: [10.0.1.100/24]
            gateway4: 10.0.1.1
            nameservers:
                addresses: [10.0.1.1]
```

Static IP addressing is highly suggested. DHCP addressing can also work, but you will still have to encode a static address in the OpenVPN configuration file.

The next step on the server is to configure the Ethernet device for promiscuous mode on boot. To do this, ensure the `networkd-dispatcher` package is installed and create the following configuration script:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install networkd-dispatcher
sudo touch /usr/lib/networkd-dispatcher/dormant.d/promisc_bridge
sudo chmod +x /usr/lib/networkd-dispatcher/dormant.d/promisc_bridge
```

Then add the following contents:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
if [ "$IFACE" = br0 ]; then
    # no networkd-dispatcher event for 'carrier' on the physical interface
    ip link set enp0s31f6 up promisc on
fi
```

#### Prepare server config for bridging

Edit `/etc/openvpn/server.conf` to use `tap` rather than `tun` and set the server to use the `server-bridge` directive:

```
;dev tun
dev tap
;server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
server-bridge 10.0.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.128 10.0.0.254
```

After configuring the server, restart OpenVPN by entering:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart openvpn@myserver
```

#### Prepare client config for bridging

The only difference on the client side for bridged mode to what was outlined above is that you need to edit `/etc/openvpn/client.conf` and set `tap` mode:

```
dev tap
;dev tun
```

Finally, restart OpenVPN:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart openvpn@client
```

You should now be able to connect to the fully remote LAN through the VPN.
