# How to configure OpenLDAP with passthrough SASL authentication using Kerberos

## Before you begin
It is assumed you are starting with a working OpenLDAP server, with a hostname of `ldap-server.example.com`. If not, follow this guide {ref}`Install and configure OpenLDAP<install-openldap>` to set it up. It is also assumed that the `EXAMPLE.COM` realm is set up, and the Kerberos client tools (krb5-user) are installed on the ldap server. You will need to create an ubuntu principal. See {ref}`How to install a Kerberos server <install-a-kerberos-server>`. You should also know how to create service principals. See {ref}`How to configure Kerberos service principals <configure-service-principals>`.
All the following configuration will be on `ldap-server.example.com`.
> **Note**:
> This process is not the same as using [Generic Security Services Application Programming Interface](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/sasl.html#GSSAPI) (GSSAPI) to log into the LDAP server.
> Rather it is using [simple authentication](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin26/security.html#%22simple%22%20method) with the OpenLDAP server so this should be over a [Transport Layer Security](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tls/documents/) (TLS) connection.
> The test user we will be using is `ubuntu@EXAMPLE.COM` which must exist in the Kerberos database

## Package installation
Install saslauthd

```bash
sudo apt install sasl2-bin
```
## Saslauthd service principal
It is assumed you have an admin principal set up in the realm. We will use `ubuntu/admin@EXAMPLE.COM`.
Next a principal who will be querying Kerberos is needed. The default for saslauthd is "host"/"hostname.domain"@"REALM". For the basic case, it is important that the hostname and domain be what nslookup on your IP number says it is.

## Check the hostname
Get the hostname from the server
```bash
hostname -f
```
Which should give you the hostname of:
```text
ldap-server.example.com
```
Also check the hostname and domain using a reverse lookup.
```bash
nslookup (your IP)
```
Check the name in the reply
```text
(Your IP).in-addr.arpa      name = ldap-server.example.com. (your IP) will be in reverse here
```
If the result is the same as your host's canonical name them all is well. If the domain is missing, the [Fully Qualified Domain Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) (FQDN) can be entered in the `/etc/hosts` file.
```bash
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```
Add the FQDN before the short hostname.
```text
(your IP) ldap-server.example.com ldap-server
```
## Create the saslauthd principal

The hostname portion of the principal must be in lowercase. You won't be creating a password for this principal so you will need to ask the kadmin tool to store the key in an external file on the LDAP server. The default location is `/etc/krb5.keytab` so you need to run the kadmin command as sudo.

```bash
sudo kadmin -p ubuntu/admin
Authenticating as principal ubuntu/admin with password.
Password for ubuntu/admin@EXAMPLE.COM
kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/ldap-server.example.com
No policy specified for host/ldap-server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM; defaulting to no policy
Principal "host/ldap-server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM" created.
kadmin: ktadd host/ldap-server.example.com
Entry for principal host/ldap-server.example.com with kvno 2, encryption type aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 added to keytab FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
Entry for principal host/ldap-server.example.com with kvno 2, encryption type aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96 added to keytab FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.
kadmin: q
```
To check our principals enter:
```bash
sudo klist -k
```
You should see the following.
```text
Keytab name: FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab
KVNO Principal
---- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   2 host/ldap-server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
   2 host/ldap-server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
```
## Configure saslauthd
Next look at the default saslauthd file located in `/etc/default/saslauthd`
```bash
sudo cat /etc/default/saslauthd
```
Here is the default config.
```text
#
# Settings for saslauthd daemon
# Please read /usr/share/doc/sasl2-bin/README.Debian for details.
#

# Description of this saslauthd instance. Recommended.
# (suggestion: SASL Authentication Daemon)
DESC="SASL Authentication Daemon"

# Short name of this saslauthd instance. Strongly recommended.
# (suggestion: saslauthd)
NAME="saslauthd"

# Which authentication mechanisms should saslauthd use? (default: pam)
#
# Available options in this Debian package:
# getpwent  -- use the getpwent() library function
# kerberos5 -- use Kerberos 5
# pam       -- use PAM
# rimap     -- use a remote IMAP server
# shadow    -- use the local shadow password file
# sasldb    -- use the local sasldb database file
# ldap      -- use LDAP (configuration is in /etc/saslauthd.conf)
#
# Only one option may be used at a time. See the saslauthd man page
# for more information.
#
# Example: MECHANISMS="pam"
MECHANISMS="pam"

# Additional options for this mechanism. (default: none)
# See the saslauthd man page for information about mech-specific options.
MECH_OPTIONS=""

# How many saslauthd processes should we run? (default: 5)
# A value of 0 will fork a new process for each connection.
THREADS=5

# Other options (default: -c -m /var/run/saslauthd)
# Note: You MUST specify the -m option or saslauthd won't run!
#
# WARNING: DO NOT SPECIFY THE -d OPTION.
# The -d option will cause saslauthd to run in the foreground instead of as
# a daemon. This will PREVENT YOUR SYSTEM FROM BOOTING PROPERLY. If you wish
# to run saslauthd in debug mode, please run it by hand to be safe.
#
# See /usr/share/doc/sasl2-bin/README.Debian for Debian-specific information.
# See the saslauthd man page and the output of 'saslauthd -h' for general
# information about these options.
#
# Example for chroot Postfix users: "-c -m /var/spool/postfix/var/run/saslauthd"
# Example for non-chroot Postfix users: "-c -m /var/run/saslauthd"
#
# To know if your Postfix is running chroot, check /etc/postfix/master.cf.
# If it has the line "smtp inet n - y - - smtpd" or "smtp inet n - - - - smtpd"
# then your Postfix is running in a chroot.
# If it has the line "smtp inet n - n - - smtpd" then your Postfix is NOT
# running in a chroot.
OPTIONS="-c -m /var/run/saslauthd"
```
Two changes are needed to use Kerberos, update MECHANISMS to kerberos5 and add START=yes

```bash
sudo vi /etc/default/saslauthd
```
Make these changes.
```text
...
# Which authentication mechanisms should saslauthd use? (default: pam)
#
# Available options in this Debian package:
# getpwent  -- use the getpwent() library function
# kerberos5 -- use Kerberos 5
# pam       -- use PAM
# rimap     -- use a remote IMAP server
# shadow    -- use the local shadow password file
# sasldb    -- use the local sasldb database file
# ldap      -- use LDAP (configuration is in /etc/saslauthd.conf)
#
# Only one option may be used at a time. See the saslauthd man page
# for more information.
#
# Example: MECHANISMS="pam"
MECHANISMS="kerberos5"
...
```
> **Note**:
> For Ubuntu version 22.04 and earlier "START=yes" must also be added to the default config file to have sasauthd restart after rebooting.
## Enable and start saslauthd
Continue by enabling the saslauthd service.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable saslauthd
```
The final step for saslauthd is to start the saslauthd service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start saslauthd
```
## Test saslauthd configuration
saslauthd can be tested with with `testsaslauthd`. For example:

```bash
testsaslauthd -u ubuntu -p ubuntusecret
0: OK "Success."
```
And with the wrong Kerberos password:
```bash
testsaslauthd -u ubuntu -p ubuntusecretwrong
0: NO "authentication failed"
```

## Configure OpenLDAP

SASL needs to know what password check method to use and where to find saslauthd socket. This can be done using the SASL config file for slapd.
```bash
sudo vi /etc/ldap/sasl2/slapd.conf
```
Add this to the file.
```text
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
saslauthd_path: /var/run/saslauthd/mux
```
Restart slapd.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart slapd
```
## Change the user password
The user we will be testing with is called ubuntu. You can add the user to the OpenLDAP directory by using the ldapadd command. Remember that the ubuntu principal exists in the Kerberos database.

```bash
ldapadd -x -D cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com -W <<LDIF
dn: uid=ubuntu,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
uid: ubuntu
cn: ubuntu
sn: ubuntu
userPassword: {SASL}ubuntu@EXAMPLE.COM
uidNumber: 10050
gidNumber: 10050
loginShell: /bin/bash
homeDirectory: /home/ubuntu

dn: cn=ubuntu,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: posixGroup
cn: ubuntu
gidNumber: 10050
memberUid: ubuntu
LDIF
```
## How the simple bind will work
When the simple bind is requested for user ubuntu, OpenLDAP will look for the password in the userPassword field.
In this case the field tells OpenLDAP to use SASL to verify the password. SASL then looks to see what method should be queried for the password verification and in this case will use saslauthd.
SASL then sends the username and password to saslauthd and here saslauthd is configured to use Kerberos. The password is then checked with the Kerberos server. Saslauthd passes back the
result to SASL which in turn passes it back to OpenLDAP which finally returns the result to the calling client.

## Test the user
Test the ubuntu user using using ldapwhoami
```bash
ldapwhoami -D uid=ubuntu,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com -W -x
Enter LDAP Password:
dn:uid=ubuntu,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
```
A successful bind will look like
```text
dn:uid=ubuntu,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
```
A failed bind will look like
```text
ldap_bind: Invalid credentials (49)
```
These LDAP users can now be used with external applications that only support "simple" username and password authentication.

## Troubleshooting
Saslauthd can be run in debug mode for more verbose messages to aid in troubleshooting
```bash
sudo systemctl stop saslauthd
sudo /usr/sbin/saslauthd -a kerberos5 -d -m /var/run/saslauthd -n 1
```
Also the `/var/log/auth.log` file can be checked for saslauthd log entries

## Advanced options
Saslauthd can be configured in the `/etc/saslauthd.conf` file. The settings depend on the authorization mechanism configured in `/etc/default/saslauthd`,
which in this case is `kerberos5`.

Some options are:
`krb5_keytab` which can override the default keytab file location of `/etc/krb5.keytab` and
`krb5_verify_principal` which changes the kerberos principle doing the verifying from `host`.

Example
```bash
sudo vi /etc/saslauthd.conf
```
Change the keytab and principal
```text
krb5_keytab: /etc/saslauthd.keytab
krb5_verify_principal: saslauthd
```
