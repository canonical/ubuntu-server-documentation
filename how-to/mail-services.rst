Mail services
**************

Sending email from one person to another over a network or the Internet
requires:

1. The sender's email client (**Mail User Agent**) sends the message.
2. One or more **Mail Transfer Agents** (MTA) to transfer the message.
3. The final MTA sends the message to a **Mail Delivery Agent** (MDA) for
   delivery to the recipient's inbox.
4. Finally, the recipient's email client retrieves the message, usually via a
   **POP3** or **IMAP** server.

These systems must all be configured correctly to successfully deliver a message.

Mail User Agent
===============

`Thunderbird <https://www.thunderbird.net/>`_ is the default Mail User Agent
(email client) used by Ubuntu. It comes pre-installed on all Ubuntu machines
from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) onwards.

If you need to install Thunderbird manually,
`this short guide <https://snapcraft.io/install/thunderbird/ubuntu>`_ will walk
you through the steps. 

Mail Transfer Agent
===================

On Ubuntu, `Postfix <https://www.postfix.org/>`_ is the default supported MTA.
It is compatible with the
`sendmail <https://www.authsmtp.com/sendmail/index.html>`_ MTA.  
  
* :ref:`Install Postfix <install-postfix>` explains how to install and configure
  Postfix, including how to configure SMTP for secure communications.


`Exim4 <https://www.exim.org/>`_ can be installed in place of sendmail,
although its configuration is quite different. 

* :ref:`Install Exim4 <install-exim4>` explains how to install and configure
  Exim4 on Ubuntu.
