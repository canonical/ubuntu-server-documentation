Managing your software
**********************

If you are new to Ubuntu, you may be wondering what to do after installation.
After all, Ubuntu is endlessly customisable according to your needs.
There are two types of software found in Ubuntu: **Debian packages** and
**snaps** -- we will learn about both!

To help you get the most from your Ubuntu experience, this tutorial will walk
you through managing the software on your Ubuntu machine. This tutorial can
be completed using either Ubuntu Server or Ubuntu Desktop.

To avoid making changes to your computer we will set up a virtual machine (VM),
which will provide us with a safe environment to run the commands in. Multipass
is great for quickly creating Ubuntu virtual machines, so we will use that.

Prerequisites
=============

* **Knowledge:**

  None! You don't even need to use an Ubuntu machine -- Multipass will give us
  an Ubuntu environment to play with.

* **Hardware:**

  The default Multipass VM will need **5 GiB of disk space**, and
  **1 GiB of memory**.

* **Software: -- Multipass**

  * On Ubuntu, you can install Multipass by running the following command in
    your terminal (you can open a terminal window by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` +
    :kbd:`Alt` + :kbd:`T` together):

    .. code-block:: bash
    
        sudo snap install multipass
    
    Or you can install it directly from
    `the Multipass page <https://snapcraft.io/multipass>`_ in the online snap
    store (make sure to select the "latest/stable" version from the dropdown
    menu next to the install button).

  * Multipass can be installed on Windows, Mac and other Linux distributions
    `using these instructions <https://multipass.run/docs/tutorial#install-multipass>`_.

Create the virtual machine
==========================

Once you have installed and run Multipass, it is straightforward to launch a
new VM. Let us launch a VM using the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS release (codename
``noble``), and let's give our VM the name ``tutorial`` using the following
command in our terminal window:

.. code-block:: bash

    multipass launch noble --name tutorial

Multipass will download the most recent daily **image** and create the VM for
us. It may take a little time, depending on the speed of your internet
connection.

An Ubuntu **image** is a collection of files we need to install and run Ubuntu.
We don't need to specify "server" or "desktop" anywhere in our command, because
the image is the same for both. The only difference between Ubuntu Server and
Ubuntu Desktop is the subset of software packages we use from the Ubuntu
Archive - we will see this later!

Now we can access the VM by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    multipass shell tutorial

We will get a "Welcome to Ubuntu" message. Notice that when we run
this command, the terminal username changes to ``ubuntu`` and the hostname
changes to ``tutorial``:

.. code-block:: bash

    ubuntu@tutorial

This shows that we are inside the VM, and this is where we will run all our
commands.

Updating the system with APT
============================

The first thing we always want to do with a new system (whether a VM, container,
bare metal, or cloud instance) is to make sure we have the latest versions
of all the pre-installed software. 

Debian packages, commonly referred to as **debs**, are the standard software
package format in Ubuntu. They can be identified by the ``.deb`` file extension. 

Every Linux distribution has their own preferred **package manager** for
installing, updating and removing packages. In Ubuntu, the default package
manager is `Advanced Packaging Tool <https://wiki.debian.org/AptCLI>`_ (or APT,
for short).

APT handles all of your system software (and other deb packages). It provides an
interface to the Ubuntu Archive *repository*, so it can access both the
**database** of all the packages available in Ubuntu, and the means to handle
the **packages** themselves.

There are two APT commands we need to update our system: ``update`` and
``upgrade``, which we will always run in that order.

apt update
----------

The ``apt update`` command is about the **database**. Any bug fixes in a package
(or new versions since your last update) will be stored in the metadata about
that package in the database (the **package index**).

When we run the ``update`` command it updates the APT database on our machine,
fetching the newest available metadata from the package index:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update

We will see an output like this:

.. code-block:: text

    Hit:1 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-security InRelease
    Hit:2 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble InRelease
    Hit:3 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates InRelease
    Hit:4 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-backports InRelease
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree... Done
    Reading state information... Done
    88 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.

As we can see, it checks ("hits") the various archives (**pockets**) that
updates can come from for the 24.04 LTS release (``noble-security``, ``noble``,
``noble-updates`` and ``noble-backports`` -- remember these, as we'll come back to
them later). It has found some packages that can be upgraded to newer versions.
If we want to see which packages those are, we can run the command hinted in
the output:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt list --upgradable

The output tells us:

- the package name and where the update will come from (e.g. ``base-files/noble-updates``),
- the most up-to-date package version available (e.g. ``13ubuntu10.1``)
- the hardware version the update is for (e.g. ``amd64``), and
- what package version is currently installed (e.g. ``13ubuntu10``)

The specific packages included in this list changes over time, so the exact
packages shown will be different, but the output will be structured like this:

.. code-block:: text

    Listing... Done
    base-files/noble-updates 13ubuntu10.1 amd64 [upgradable from: 13ubuntu10]
    bsdextrautils/noble-updates 2.39.3-9ubuntu6.1 amd64 [upgradable from: 2.39.3-9ubuntu6]
    bsdutils/noble-updates 1:2.39.3-9ubuntu6.1 amd64 [upgradable from: 1:2.39.3-9ubuntu6]
    cloud-init/noble-updates 24.2-0ubuntu1~24.04.2 all [upgradable from: 24.1.3-0ubuntu3.3]
    [...]

apt upgrade
-----------

The ``apt upgrade`` command is about the **packages** on your system. It looks
at the metadata in the package index we just updated, finds the packages with
available upgrades, and lists them for us. Once we've checked the proposed
upgrade and are happy to proceed, it will then install the newer versions for
us.

After we have updated the database (which we did by running ``apt update``) we
can then upgrade the packages to their newest versions by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt upgrade

When we run this command, it will ask us to confirm if the summary of proposed
changes that will be made to our system is what we want.

Let's type :kbd:`Y`, then press :kbd:`Enter` to confirm that yes, we do
want that, and then the upgrade will proceed. This may take a few minutes.

.. tip::
   You can use the ``-y`` flag, which is a shorthand for ``--assume-yes``. If we ran
   the command ``sudo apt upgrade -y`` it would proceed with the upgrade without
   asking us to confirm. Shorthand versions of flags are common -- for most
   packages, you can check which flags are equivalent using
   `the manual pages <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/>`_ or using the ``man``
   command, as we'll see later. 

In the output, we'll see where ``apt upgrade`` is fetching the upgrade from for
each package. For example:

.. code-block:: text

    Get:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates/main amd64 libopeniscsiusr amd64 2.1.9-3ubuntu5.1 [49.1 kB]

APT combines the various elements; the package name (``libopeniscsiusr``),
version (``2.1.9-3ubuntu5.1``), source (``noble-updates/main``), etc into a
single URL that it can use for the download. The package is then unpacked, and
the upgrade applied to the system.

.. note::
    These commands only upgrade the packages for the release of Ubuntu that we
    are using (24.04 LTS). If we wanted to upgrade the entire system to the
    next release of Ubuntu (e.g. from 22.04 LTS to 24.04 LTS), we would use the
    ``do-release-upgrade`` command. See this guide on
    :ref:`how to upgrade your release <upgrade-your-release>` for more information.

It's important to know that ``apt upgrade`` will only handle packages that can be
straightforwardly upgraded. If the package has **dependency** issues (i.e., the
version you have "depends" on other packages that also need to be added,
upgraded or removed), you would need to use ``sudo apt dist-upgrade`` instead.
The ``dist-upgrade`` command is able to resolve conflicts between package
versions, but it *could* end up removing some packages -- so although
``apt upgrade`` is safe to use unattended (in a script, for example), you should
only use ``dist-upgrade`` when you can pay attention to it.

Searching with APT
------------------

Now we're up-to-date, we can start exploring! As with any other database, we
can search the list of available packages using APT in order to find software.
Let's say that we want to find a webserver, for example. We can run the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt search webserver

This will return us a long list of all "webserver" packages it can find. But
some of the descriptions don't actually contain the text "webserver" -- like in
this section of the list:

.. code-block:: text

    inotify-tools/noble 3.22.6.0-4 amd64
      command-line programs providing a simple interface to inotify

    ipcalc/noble 0.51-1 all
      parameter calculator for IPv4 addresses

    iwatch/noble 0.2.2-10 all
      realtime filesystem monitoring program using inotify

We can use ``apt show`` to inspect the description and summary details of any
package, so let's take a closer look at ``ipcalc`` from our list:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt show ipcalc

The summary has been replaced with ``[...]`` for brevity, but we can see that the
text "webserver" is in the long description of the "Description" field.

.. code-block:: text

    Package: ipcalc
    Version: 0.51-1
    [...]
    APT-Sources: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble/universe amd64 Packages
    Description: parameter calculator for IPv4 addresses
     ipcalc takes an IPv4 address and netmask and calculates the resulting
     broadcast, network, Cisco wildcard mask, and host range. By giving a
     second netmask, you can design sub- and supernetworks. It is also
     intended to be a teaching tool and presents the results as
     easy-to-understand binary values.
     .
     Originally, ipcalc was intended for use from the shell prompt, but a
     CGI wrapper is provided to enable colorful HTML display through a
     webserver.
     You can find it in /usr/share/doc/ipcalc/examples directory.

In many places, you will see reference to ``apt-get`` and ``apt-cache`` instead
of ``apt``. Historically, the *database* part of APT was accessed using
``apt-cache`` (e.g. ``apt-cache show ipcalc``), and the *packages* part of APT
used ``apt-get`` (e.g. ``apt-get install ipcalc``).

APT has recently been streamlined, so although it uses ``apt-get`` and
``apt-cache`` "behind the scenes" (and these commands do still work), we don't
need to worry about remembering which command to use -- we can use the more
convenient ``apt`` directly. To find out more about these packages and how to
use them (or indeed, any package in Ubuntu!) we can refer to the manual pages.

Run ``man apt``, ``man apt-get`` or ``man apt-cache`` in the terminal to access
the manuals for these packages on the command line, or view the same content in
the `online manual pages <https://manpages.ubuntu.com>`_.

Installing deb packages
=======================

For the examples for this section, we're going to use the popular webserver
package, `Apache2 <https://httpd.apache.org/>`_.

APT gives us a lot of details about what will be included in the installation,
and it's always important to understand the implications of a command
*before* we run it. We'll be taking a close look at the details APT gives us,
so we need to be careful in this section.

When we run a command that asks us "``Do you want to continue? [Y/n]``", make
sure to type :kbd:`N` for "no" and then press :kbd:`Enter` unless instructed
otherwise -- this will let us see the output of the commands without making
changes that then need to be undone.

Installing deb packages using APT is done using the ``apt install`` command.
We can install either a single package, or a list of packages at once, by
including their names in a space-separated list after the ``install`` command,
in this format:

.. code-block:: text

    sudo apt install <package 1> <package 2> <package 3>


About ``sudo``
--------------

We've seen the ``sudo`` prefix in a couple of commands already, and you may be
wondering what that's about. In Linux, system tasks (like installing software)
need elevated administrator permissions. These permissions are often called
"root access", and a user with root access is called a "root user".

However, it can be dangerous to operate your machine as a root user -- since
root access gives you full system control the whole time, it allows you to
change or delete important system files. It's very easy to accidentally break
your system in root mode!

Instead, we use ``sudo`` (which is short for ``superuser do``). This command is
a safety feature that grants regular users *temporary* (per command) admin
privileges to make system changes. It's still important for us to always
understand what a command does before we run it, but using ``sudo`` means we
purposefully limit any potential mistakes to a single command.

About dependencies
------------------

As we hinted earlier, packages often come with **dependencies** -- other
packages that *your* package needs so it can function. Sometimes, a package
might depend on a specific version of another package. If a package has
dependencies, then installing a package via ``apt`` will also install any
dependencies, which ensures the software can function properly.

APT tells us how it will resolve any dependency conflicts or issues when we run
the ``install`` command. Let's try this for ourselves, but remember, we
**don't** want to proceed with the install yet, so let's type :kbd:`N` when it
asks us if we want to continue:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2

The output should be similar to the below. It tells us:

- which packages we have but don't need (we'll talk about that in the
  "autoremove" section),
- additional packages that will be installed (these are our dependencies),
- suggested packages (which we'll discuss in the next section), and
- a summary of which *new* packages will be present on the system after the
  install is done (which in this case is ``apache2`` itself, and all its
  dependencies).

.. code-block:: text

    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree... Done

    The following additional packages will be installed:

    Suggested packages:

    The following NEW packages will be installed:

    0 upgraded, 10 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
    Need to get 2084 kB of archives.
    After this operation, 8094 kB of additional disk space will be used.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 

Let's try and make sense of this output. 

Types of dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The relationship between a package and any other packages follows the
`Debian policy on binary dependencies <https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#binary-dependencies-depends-recommends-suggests-enhances-pre-depends>`_,
which we'll briefly look at here. The most common ones you might come
across are: ``depends``, ``recommends``, and ``suggests`` (although there are
others!), so we'll take a look at these three.

- **depends**: Absolutely required, the package won't work without it. If we try
  to remove a package that is depended on by another, both will be removed! 
- **recommends**: Strongly dependent, but not absolutely necessary (which means
  the package will work better with it, but can still function without it)
- **suggests**: Not needed, but may enhance the usefulness of the package in
  some way.

We can see, using ``apt show``, exactly which packages fall into each of these
categories. Let's use Apache2 as our example again:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt show apache2

If we look only at the sections on dependencies, we can see that ``ssl-cert`` is
a recommended package:

.. code-block:: text

    [...]
    Provides: httpd, httpd-cgi
    Pre-Depends: init-system-helpers (>= 1.54~)
    Depends: apache2-bin (= 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4), apache2-data (= 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4), apache2-utils (= 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4), media-types, perl:any, procps
    Recommends: ssl-cert
    Suggests: apache2-doc, apache2-suexec-pristine | apache2-suexec-custom, www-browser, ufw
    [...]

In Ubuntu, the default configuration of ``apt install`` is set to install
recommended packages alongside ``depends``, so when we ran the
``apt install apache2`` command, ``ssl-cert`` was included in the proposed
packages to be installed (even though it's only recommended, not strictly needed).

We can override this behaviour by passing the ``--no-install-recommends`` flag to
our command, like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2 --no-install-recommends

Then the output becomes the following (type :kbd:`N` at the prompt again to
avoid installing for now):

.. code-block:: text

    [...]
    The following additional packages will be installed:
      apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-utils libapr1t64 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap libaprutil1t64 liblua5.4-0
    Suggested packages:
      apache2-doc apache2-suexec-pristine | apache2-suexec-custom www-browser
    Recommended packages:
      ssl-cert
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
      apache2 apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-utils libapr1t64 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap libaprutil1t64 liblua5.4-0
    0 upgraded, 9 newly installed, 0 to remove and 25 not upgraded.
    [...]

Now, we see that ``ssl-cert`` is only mentioned as a recommended package, but
is excluded from the list of packages to be installed.

There is a second flag we could pass -- the ``--install-suggests`` flag. This
will not only install the strict dependencies and recommended packages, but
*also* the suggested packages. From our previous output, it doesn't look like
too much, right? It's only four additional packages.

But actually, if we run this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2 --install-suggests

There is now an extremely long list of suggested packages (which I will not
output here, but you can try it for yourself!). In fact, the number of
suggested packages is so long that there is not enough space in this VM to
install them all, so it won't even give us the option to proceed:

.. code-block:: text

    [...]
    0 upgraded, 4598 newly installed, 2 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
    Need to get 7415 MB of archives.
    After this operation, 19.6 GB of additional disk space will be used.
    E: You don't have enough free space in /var/cache/apt/archives/.

This is because each of these suggested packages also comes with their own
lists of dependencies, including suggested packages, all of which would *also*
be installed. It's perhaps clear to see why this is not the default setting!

What if we remove a dependency?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We'll go into more detail about removing packages later, but for now, let's see
what happens if we remove a required *dependency*. First, we should (finally!)
install the ``apache2`` package. Let's run the following command again, but this
time when we are asked whether we want to continue, let's press :kbd:`Y` and
then :kbd:`Enter` to confirm, and APT will install the package:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2

One of the required dependencies is the ``apache2-data`` package. Let's try to
remove it using ``apt remove``:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt remove apache2-data

Once again, ``apt`` won't proceed without confirmation, so we get the following
output -- let's take a look before choose anything:

.. code-block:: text

    [...]
    The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
      apache2-bin apache2-utils libapr1t64 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap libaprutil1t64 liblua5.4-0 ssl-cert
    Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
    The following packages will be REMOVED:
      apache2 apache2-data
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 2 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
    After this operation, 1342 kB disk space will be freed.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n]

Let's break this down a little bit, because there are some subtle differences
here that we want to understand before we proceed.

- "The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer
  required"

  These were other dependencies that ``apache2`` needed, but none of them depend
  upon ``apache2-data``, so even if we remove ``apache2`` and ``apache2-data``
  they would still be functional -- they just aren't used by any other installed
  packages...and so have no reason to be there anymore. They won't be removed,
  APT is helpfully telling us so we're aware of them.

- "The following packages will be REMOVED"

  These are the packages that will be removed directly - we've told APT we
  want to remove ``apache2-data``, so we expect that to be included, but it will
  also remove ``apache2`` itself! This is because ``apache2-data`` is a required
  dependency, and ``apache2`` won't function *at all* without it.
  
Let's now choose :kbd:`Y` to confirm we want to remove this dependency.

.. warning::
   Removing dependencies can, at worst, cause a system to become unusable -- you
   should always be careful when doing so. If you remove a dependency that is
   part of a chain, the removals will cascade up the chain as each dependency
   and the package that depends on it are removed. You can end up removing more
   than you originally anticipated!


Autoremove dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So, we have removed the ``apache2`` and ``apache2-data`` packages, but the other
dependencies that were installed alongside ``apache2`` are still there. The
output of our ``remove`` command gave us the hint about how to deal with these
redundant packages -- the ``autoremove`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt autoremove

When we run this command, ``apt`` once again gives us a summary of the operation
we requested, but let's choose :kbd:`N` for now when it asks if we want to
continue:

.. code-block:: text

    [...]
    The following packages will be REMOVED:
      apache2-bin apache2-utils libapr1t64 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap libaprutil1t64 liblua5.4-0 ssl-cert
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 8 to remove and 2 not upgraded.
    After this operation, 6751 kB disk space will be freed.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 

You may be wondering why we don't need to specify any packages when we call the
``autoremove`` command -- after all, we've just been dealing with packages
related to ``apache2``. This is because ``apt`` will check all the packages on
your system. It examines the dependency tree, and if the original reason for the
package to be installed no longer exists (i.e., it isn't needed by anything),
it will be flagged for autoremoval.

But!

We might, in the future, uninstall Apache2 without uninstalling the redundant
packages at the time. We might have found another use for ``ssl-cert``, perhaps
in a script that makes use of SSL certificates. So how can we keep the
``ssl-cert`` package, even though it's flagged for autoremoval?

We can solve this problem, and un-flag the ``ssl-cert`` package for removal, by
*manually* installing it:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install ssl-cert

This sets ``ssl-cert`` to **manually installed**. We might well wonder "why
didn't APT didn't ask us to confirm anything this time?". In this case, it's
because ``ssl-cert`` is already present on the system so APT doesn't need to
install anything new.

.. code-block:: text

    [...]
    ssl-cert is already the newest version (1.1.2ubuntu1).
    ssl-cert set to manually installed.
    The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
      apache2-bin apache2-utils libapr1t64 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap libaprutil1t64 liblua5.4-0
    Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded.

If the ``ssl-cert`` package is manually installed on our system, by us, then
``apt`` knows the package is wanted, and we can see that it has been removed
from the autoremove list so our next autoremove will not uninstall it. Let's
test this, just to make sure!

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt autoremove

This time we'll select :kbd:`Y` when prompted, and then we can run
``apt list ssl-cert`` to quickly see if our ``ssl-cert`` package is still on
the system:

.. code-block:: bash

   apt list ssl-cert

Which gives us this output, confirming that ``ssl-cert`` is currently installed:

.. code-block:: text

    Listing... Done
    ssl-cert/noble,now 1.1.2ubuntu1 all [installed]

If you're curious, you can also run ``apt list apache2`` to see how the output
differs for a package that was once installed and then removed!

Anyway, we're not quite finished with the Apache2 package, so let's reinstall
it:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2

And this time select :kbd:`Y` to confirm when it asks.

Customise configuration
=======================

In general, the default package configuration should just work well, and work
"out of the box" when it's installed. But it's almost inevitable that, sooner
or later, we'll want to customise the package so that it better fits our own
purposes.

Before we try to customise the package, we should probably look at what files
are included in it. We can check this using ``dpkg``, which is the
`Debian package manager <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/en/man1/dpkg.1.html>`_.
Although APT is now more commonly used for basic package handling, ``dpkg``
retains some really helpful commands for examining files and finding out
package information. It's installed by default on Ubuntu systems so we can use
it directly:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --listfiles ssl-cert

This gives us the following list of files and their directory structure (the
end of the list is truncated for brevity):

.. code-block:: text

    /.
    /etc
    /etc/ssl
    /etc/ssl/certs
    /etc/ssl/private
    /lib
    diverted by base-files to: /lib.usr-is-merged
    /lib/systemd
    /lib/systemd/system
    /lib/systemd/system/ssl-cert.service
    /usr
    /usr/sbin
    /usr/sbin/make-ssl-cert
    /usr/share
    /usr/share/doc
    /usr/share/doc/ssl-cert
    /usr/share/doc/ssl-cert/README
    [...]

If we find a file but we're not sure what package it comes from, ``dpkg`` can
help us there too! Let's use the example of one of the files from the previous
output: ``/usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf`` and do a search for it using
``dpkg``:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --search /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf

This will provide us with the package name for the given file:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssl-cert: /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf

Although this seems obvious to us, because we already know the source of this
file, the ``dpkg`` search function is really useful for tracking down the
sources of files we don't know about!

Conffiles
---------

Most of a package's configuration is handled through
`configuration files <https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ap-pkg-conffiles.html#automatic-handling-of-configuration-files-by-dpkg>`_
(often known as **conffiles**). Conffiles often contain things like file paths,
logs and debugging configuration, kernel parameters (which can be changed to
optimise system performance), access control, and other configuration settings.
The actual parameters available will vary from one package to another.

Package conffiles are different from all other files delivered in a package.
A package may have any number of conffiles (including none!). Conffiles are
explicitly marked by the package maintainer during development to protect local
configuration from being overwritten during upgrades so that your changes are
saved. This is not the case for any other types of files -- changes you make to
regular files in that package *will be overwritten* during an upgrade. 

How upgrades are handled
------------------------

Since a conffile can be changed by us, we might end up with conflicts when the
package maintainer changes those same files. Therefore, it's important to
understand how such conflicts are handled.

We can show the four possible upgrade scenarios using the following table. What
happens during an upgrade depends on whether the conffile on our system has
been changed by us ("changed/not changed by user"), and whether the version's
default content has been changed by the package maintainer ("changed/not
changed by maintainer"):

========================== ============================= =========================
The conffile is...         **not changed by maintainer** **changed by maintainer**
========================== ============================= =========================
**...changed by user**     Keep user's changes           Ask user                 
**...not changed by user** No changes to make            Apply changes from update
========================== ============================= =========================

So we can see that if we do make changes to a conffile, APT will never
overwrite our changes without asking us first. 

Identifying conffiles
---------------------

Out of the list of files in a package, how do we know which ones are the
conffiles?

After all, they are not marked by any particular file extension, and
although they are often found in the ``/etc/`` directory, they don't *have* to
be there. As we saw before, the only thing conffiles have in common is that the
package maintainer decided to mark them as such.

But that's our clue! So once more, ``dpkg`` can come to our rescue. The
following command will show us (``--show``) the subset of files in the
``apache2`` package that have been marked as "``Conffiles``"
(``-f='${Conffiles}\n'``) by the maintainer and shows each on a new line
(``\n``) in the output:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg-query --show -f='${Conffiles}\n' apache2

If you want to understand more about what this command does, you can refer to
the manual page by typing ``man dpkg-query --show``, and it will talk you
through all the options.

Unlike ``dpkg --listfiles``, ``dpkg-query`` *also* gives us a string of letters
and numbers. This string is known as the **"MD5 checksum"** or **"MD5 hash"**. 

.. code-block:: text

     /etc/apache2/apache2.conf 354c9e6d2b88a0a3e0548f853840674c
     /etc/apache2/conf-available/charset.conf e6fbb8adf631932851d6cc522c1e48d7
     /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf 332668933023a463046fa90d9b057193
     /etc/apache2/envvars e4431a53c868ae0dfcde68564f3ce6a7
     /etc/apache2/magic a6d370833a02f53db6a0a30800704994
    [...]

We can see the checksum of a specific file by running this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    md5sum /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Which returns us the checksum followed by the file and its location:

.. code-block:: bash

    354c9e6d2b88a0a3e0548f853840674c  /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

You might well be wondering "why do we care about that?" since they match (in
this example).

The checksum is like a fingerprint - it's unique for every *version* of a file,
so any time the file is changed it will get a new checksum -- which allows us
to see **if a file has been changed** from the default. 

Verifying checksums
-------------------

Let's set up a situation so we can poke a bit at this idea. We can start by
making some changes to a conffile. In Apache2, the main conffile is
``/etc/apache2/apache2.conf``, so let's use that. In a situation where we are
setting up a new webserver, we might reasonably want to increase the
``LogLevel`` from "warn" to "debug" to get more debugging messages, so let's
run this command and use ``sed`` to make that change in the conffile:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo sed -e 's/LogLevel warn/LogLevel debug/' -i /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

We won't be prompted to confirm if we want to make these changes -- but we do
need root access so we use ``sudo`` in our command. As we hinted in the section
about ``sudo``, the fact that we can make these changes without needing to
confirm is why it can be so easy to break your system when you're operating as
root! Try running the command without the ``sudo``, and you will get a
"permission denied" error.

Next, we'll restart our Apache2 server so that we can activate our configuration
changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl restart apache2

Now if we run the ``md5sum`` command again, we can see the hash changed:

.. code-block:: bash

    ubuntu@tutorial:~$ md5sum /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

    1109a77001754a836fb4a1378f740702  /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

This works great if we know that there's a file *we* changed, but what about if
someone else tampered with a file, and we don't know which one? In that case,
we can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --verify apache2

This will verify the checksums of the files on our system against those held in
the package index for ``apache2``, and return a rather strange looking result
if (or when) it finds a mismatch:

.. code-block:: text

    ??5?????? c /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Which is exactly what we were expecting to see, since we know we changed this
file.

But what if something else was messed with...something that shouldn't be, and
something not changed by us? Let's make a "silly" change to a different file to
test this -- in this case, changing all instances of the word "warning" to
"silly" in a random package file:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo sed -e 's/warning/silly/' -i /usr/sbin/a2enmod

And then run the verification again with:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --verify apache2

We now see something that looks like this:

.. code-block:: bash

    ??5?????? c /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    ??5??????   /usr/sbin/a2enmod

.. note::
    You might have noticed there's a "c" next to the top line but not the
    bottom -- the "c" shows the file is a conffile.

``dpkg`` can tell that the file has been changed, but won't tell us what the
change was. However, since the file in question is not a conffile, we know that
the change *won't be preserved* if we upgrade the package. This means that we
can overwrite the changes and restore the default package content by
"reinstalling" Apache2:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install --reinstall apache2

By using the ``--reinstall`` flag, we can force ``apt`` to re-unpack all of the
default content. If we then verify once more...

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --verify apache2

Then we'll get this output:

.. code-block:: text

    ??5?????? c /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

...so we can see that our change to the conffile has been preserved because
the checksums are different, but the ``a2enmod`` file isn't listed anymore
because it has been restored to the default. Phew!

.. note::
   We can use ``sudo apt install <package>`` to upgrade an installed package,
   but this will only upgrade to the latest version. In our case, we were
   already on the latest version of Apache2, so we needed to force APT to
   re-unpack the content to overwrite our "silly" changes.

Removing packages
=================

Since we have just reinstalled the Apache2 package, we know it is in good
shape. But what if we decide we're done with it and just want to remove it? 
Then we can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt remove apache2

Which will give us an output like this:

.. code-block:: text

    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree... Done
    Reading state information... Done
    The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
      apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-utils libapr1t64 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3
      libaprutil1-ldap libaprutil1t64 liblua5.4-0
    Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
    The following packages will be REMOVED:
      apache2
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 44 not upgraded.
    After this operation, 465 kB disk space will be freed.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 

Let's type :kbd:`Y` to proceed. 

As before, we see that the dependencies will still be there even when
``apache2`` has been removed. Let's check with ``dpkg``...

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --listfiles apache2

...and see what else might be left behind...

.. code-block:: bash

    /etc
    /etc/apache2
    /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
    /etc/apache2/conf-available
    /etc/apache2/conf-available/charset.conf
    /etc/apache2/conf-available/localized-error-pages.conf
    /etc/apache2/conf-available/other-vhosts-access-log.conf
    /etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf
    /etc/apache2/conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
    /etc/apache2/conf-enabled
    /etc/apache2/envvars
    /etc/apache2/magic
    /etc/apache2/mods-available
    /etc/apache2/mods-available/access_compat.load
    /etc/apache2/mods-available/actions.conf
    [...]


This looks suspiciously like the list of conffiles we saw earlier, right?

Also removing configuration
---------------------------

As it turns out, removing a package doesn't automatically remove the conffiles.
But -- this is intentional, for our convenience.

By leaving the conffiles in place, if we decide to reinstall ``apache2`` again
in the future, we don't need to spend time setting up all our configuration
again.

Let's see the difference in installing ``apache2`` after it has been installed
(and removed) compared to the first time we installed it:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2

Notice that it did not ask us to confirm if we wanted to proceed this time.
Why not? As we saw earlier, the "Y/n" confirmation is shown when there are
dependencies, and we know that Apache2 *has* dependencies.

...Ah! But this time, we didn't run ``autoremove`` when we uninstalled Apache2,
so the dependencies are still installed on our system. This means that when we
ask ``apt`` to install ``apache2`` now, there is nothing missing and we are
getting *exactly* what we are asking for.

Since the dependencies and conffiles are still there, we can use our former
config immediately. It even retains the changes we made before, which we can
verify by looking at the checksum again:

.. code-block:: bash

    md5sum /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Removing and purging
--------------------

What if we decide that we don't want the changed conffiles? Perhaps we want
to go back to the default installation, or we know we won't want to use the
package ever again -- how can we ensure that all the conffiles are removed at
the same time as we remove the package?

In that case, we can use the ``--purge`` option of the ``remove`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt remove --purge apache2

Which will give us this output:

.. code-block:: bash

    [...]
    The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
      apache2-bin apache2-data apache2-utils libapr1t64 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3
      libaprutil1-ldap libaprutil1t64 liblua5.4-0
    Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.
    The following packages will be REMOVED:
      apache2*
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 1 to remove and 9 not upgraded.
    After this operation, 465 kB disk space will be freed.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] 

If we look very carefully, we see a little asterisk (\*) in the output.

.. code-block:: bash

    The following packages will be REMOVED:
      apache2*

This tiny indicator tells us that the package will be removed AND purged.
However, it still does not remove the dependencies (or the conffiles
of those dependencies).

Let's type :kbd:`Y` again to confirm we want to proceed. Then, once the
removal is complete, we can check the list once more:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --listfiles apache2

And this time, the output is very different!

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg-query: package 'apache2' is not installed
    Use dpkg --contents (= dpkg-deb --contents) to list archive files contents.

.. note::
    We could also use the ``dpkg-query --show -f='${Conffiles}\n' apache2``
    command from earlier, and ``dpkg-query`` will find no packages matching
    ``apache2``.

There are other ways to change package files. If you would like to read more,
check out our
:ref:`guide to changing package files <changing-package-files>`.

What else is on our system?
===========================

As we saw earlier, we can search the APT package database for keywords using
``apt search <keyword>`` to find software we might want to install. We can also
see all the packages we already have using ``apt list``, although it can be
easier to navigate and more informative if we use ``dpkg -l`` instead -- then
we can use the up and down arrow keys on our keyboard to scroll (or press
:kbd:`Q` to return to our terminal prompt).

For every package, we can see what versions of it exist in the database:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt policy apache2

This will return a summary of all the versions that exist on our particular
Ubuntu release, ordered by "most recent" first:

.. code-block:: text

    apache2:
      Installed: (none)
      Candidate: 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4
      Version table:
         2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4 500
            500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates/main amd64 Packages
            500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-security/main amd64 Packages
            100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
         2.4.58-1ubuntu8 500
            500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble/main amd64 Packages

We know that Apache2 isn't installed right now, because we removed and purged
it, which is why the installed version shows as "none":

.. code-block:: text

    Installed: (none)

If we were to install the default package, we would get this one:

.. code-block:: text

    Candidate: 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4

Under each version we are also shown the **source**. The newest version
(``2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4``) comes from ``noble-updates`` (main) and
``noble-security`` (main). The *original* version (``2.4.58-1ubuntu8``) comes
from ``noble`` (main). This tells us that this was the version released with
the with 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).

Installing older package versions
---------------------------------

We can install specific older versions if we want to, for example, to satisfy
dependency requirements of another package. We can do that by specifying the
package name and version:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install <package=version>

However, this can be tricky and often leads to conflicts in dependency
versions as APT always wants to install the most recent version. We can see an
example of this if we run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2=2.4.58-1ubuntu8

APT warns us that the version of apache2 we want to install depends
on earlier versions of the dependencies, but it helpfully tells us which
dependency versions we need to successfully install the package we want.

.. code-block:: text

    [...]
    Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
    requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
    distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
    or been moved out of Incoming.
    The following information may help to resolve the situation:

    The following packages have unmet dependencies:
     apache2 : Depends: apache2-bin (= 2.4.58-1ubuntu8) but 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4 is to be installed
               Depends: apache2-data (= 2.4.58-1ubuntu8) but 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4 is to be installed
               Depends: apache2-utils (= 2.4.58-1ubuntu8) but 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4 is to be installed
    E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

So, all we need to do is first install the dependencies, and then run the
install command again. Remember that we can install multiple packages at once
by separating them with spaces:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install apache2-bin=2.4.58-1ubuntu8 \
      apache2-data=2.4.58-1ubuntu8 \
      apache2-utils=2.4.58-1ubuntu8 \
      apache2=2.4.58-1ubuntu8

In this case we're also breaking the command over multiple lines using
backslashes (``\``) to make it easier to read, but it will still be run as a
single command.

APT will warn us that we are downgrading the package, but let us press
:kbd:`Y` to confirm (when prompted), and it will go ahead and downgrade us
anyway. Let's run the following command again:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt policy apache2

And we'll get confirmation that we're running on an older version:

.. code-block:: text

    apache2:
      Installed: 2.4.58-1ubuntu8
      Candidate: 2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4
      Version table:
         2.4.58-1ubuntu8.4 500
            500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-updates/main amd64 Packages
            500 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble-security/main amd64 Packages
     *** 2.4.58-1ubuntu8 500
            500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu noble/main amd64 Packages
            100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

Where do packages come from?
----------------------------

You may be wondering by now "where exactly do all these packages come from?".
We've spotted a few sources very briefly throughout this tutorial, but haven't
paid direct attention to them yet. Let's take a little time now to define what
we mean by all these different sources that APT can pull packages from.

The source behind APT is the **Ubuntu Package Archive**. This Archive splits
into many layers, each with its own terminology.
The different terminology is quite confusing at first, but we've seen a few of
the terms already. So if we take a look, layer-by-layer, we'll see not just what
all the terms mean, but how they all fit together.

Let's have a quick overview with this diagram. The general flow is that the
Archive splits into **Ubuntu series**. Each series is split up into **pockets**,
and then each pocket contains four **components**. If we tried to show all of
this on one diagram, it would be quite extensive, so let's take a look through
a single path.

      style R fill:#fff,stroke:#cfcfcf,stroke-width:2px;

Series
^^^^^^

The **series** is a set of packages that are released with a specific version
of Ubuntu -- they're usually referred to by their codename (e.g., ``mantic``,
``noble`` and ``oracular`` in our diagram). Each version of Ubuntu may have
multiple releases (for example, an LTS will have an initial release when it
launches (e.g. 24.04 LTS), and then "subsequent point releases" (e.g. 24.04.1
LTS) -- these are all part of the same series (``noble``).

In practice, people often use the term "Ubuntu release" and "Ubuntu series"
interchangeably.

Pockets
^^^^^^^

Every Ubuntu series (``noble``, ``jammy``, etc) is split into **pockets**,
which are related to the software development/release lifecycle:

- **-release** contains the packages as they are at release time.
- **-proposed** contains package updates while they are being tested.
- Once an update is released, they come from either **-security** or
  **-updates** depending on whether they are a security-related update or not.
- And **-backports**, which contains packages that were not available at release
  time.

This is why earlier, we saw that some updates came from ``noble-updates`` or
``noble-security``. These refer to updates and security updates from the noble
series (respectively). Pockets are usually appended to the end of the series,
and it's quite common to see the hyphen (``-``) included when referring to
pockets. 

Remember -- the original version of the ``apache2`` package we saw came from
``noble``. The ``-release`` pocket only includes the software that was part of
the original LTS release, and so it takes the name of the Ubuntu series by
default (i.e., the ``-release`` pocket is implied). 

Components
^^^^^^^^^^

Each pocket is split into four **components**, depending on whether the packages
they contain are *open source* or *closed source*, and whether they are
officially supported by Canonical or are maintained by the Ubuntu Community:

+--------------------------+-------------+---------------+
|                          | Open source | Closed source |
+==========================+=============+===============+
| **Officially supported** | main        | restricted    |
+--------------------------+-------------+---------------+
| **Community supported**  | universe    | multiverse    |
+--------------------------+-------------+---------------+

- **main** contains the open-source packages that are officially supported by
  Canonical. These packages are either installed on every Ubuntu machine, or
  are very widely used for various types of systems and use-cases.
- **universe** holds all other open-source packages in Ubuntu, which are
  typically maintained by the Debian and Ubuntu communities, but may also
  include additional security coverage from Canonical under
  `Ubuntu Pro <https://ubuntu.com/pro>`_, which is available free for personal
  use on up to five machines.
- **restricted** contains the packages that are officially supported by
  Canonical but are not available under a completely free license.
- **multiverse** contains community-maintained proprietary software -- these
  packages are completely unsupported by Canonical.

If you would like more information about the Ubuntu release process, how
packages are produced, or to learn more about the sort of terminology you might
come across, you may be interested in the
`Ubuntu Packaging Guide <https://canonical-ubuntu-packaging-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/archive/>`_,
which is a great resource containing all this information (and much more!).

Installing a .deb file
======================

Although APT is the preferred way to install packages on your system, due to
its ability to handle depedencies and keep software up-to-date, not every
package is available in the APT repository -- especially if they are so old
they are no longer maintained, or conversely, are the newest version still in
development!

We can install .deb files that aren't in the APT repository using ``dpkg`` --
all we need is to download the .deb file, and we can run a command like this to
install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo dpkg -i <file-name.deb>

But -- APT is helpful here too. Even if we get a .deb file that isn't from the
Ubuntu Archive, we can still install it with APT so that if there are
dependencies that can be resolved automatically from the Archive -- they will
be!

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install ./file-name.deb

If we ever do want to install a .deb file, APT is definitely the most
convenient way to do it. We may still need to handle *some* dependencies
manually, but now we have the knowledge to be able to do that.

Luckily, most of the packages you will ever need are likely to be found through
APT. If it's not, it's worth checking if the software is available as a **snap**
instead.

.. _tutorial_snaps:

Snaps
=====

Snaps are a newer, self-contained software format that were developed to be
a more portable and easy-to-use alternative to debs. They come with all their
dependencies pre-bundled so that there is no need for a package management tool
to track dependencies, and they run inside sandboxed environments that limit
their interactions with the rest of the system.

Instead of **versions** as we have them in debs, snaps use the concept of
`channels <https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels>`_ to define which release of a
snap is installed.

By default, snaps are kept automatically up-to-date, so we don't need to
remember to update and upgrade them. There are times on a live system, such as
a server in a production environment, where we might not want to have updates
automatically applied. In those cases, we can
`turn off automatic updates <https://snapcraft.io/docs/managing-updates>`_ and
refresh the system snaps when it's convenient (for example, during a
maintenance window).

If you would like to try out snaps, we recommend the excellent
`quickstart tour <https://snapcraft.io/docs/quickstart-tour>`_ tutorial in the
snap documentation. Feel free to continue using the VM we've been using in
this tutorial while exploring!

Completion!
===========

Once you are finished and want to leave the tutorial, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    exit

This will take you out of the VM and back to your live machine. Then, you can
run the following commands to delete the VM and remove it completely from your
machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    multipass delete tutorial
    multipass purge

Summary
=======

Congratulations, we made it to the end! We've covered a lot of material in this
tutorial, so let's do a quick recap of what we've learned:

**Finding, installing and removing packages**

* How to update and upgrade all our system's software with APT:
  * ``sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade``

* How to search for software using keywords or strings:
  * ``apt search <keyword>`` or ``apt search "some content string"`` 

* How to see the description of a package, including what dependencies it has:
  * ``apt show <package name>``
  
  Or how to check what package versions are available:
  * ``apt policy <package>``

* How to install packages...
  * ``sudo apt install <package1> <package2>``

* How to see all the files a package contains
  * ``dpkg --listfiles <package>``

* How to find out what package a file belongs to:
  * ``dpkg --search <path/to/file>``

* ...And how to remove packages again! As well as the difference between removing and purging.
  * ``sudo apt remove <package>``

* We even learned how to downgrade to older versions of APT packages, and all
  about APT sources.

**Customising package configuration**

* How to find the conffiles in a package:
  * ``dpkg-query --show -f='${Conffiles}\n' <package>``

* How to see if package files have been changed:
  * ``dpkg --verify <package>``

* ...And if a non-conffile has been changed by accident, we can fix it with:
  * ``sudo apt install --reinstall <package>``

* We know that our changes to conffiles are always safely preserved, while
  changes to non-conffiles are reverted at the next upgrade or security fix.

* Importantly, we know how to verify checksums with ``md5sum`` or similar
  tools, which helps us to more safely build packages from source.

* And finally, we learned about snaps!
