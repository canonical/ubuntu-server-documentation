    ABI
        ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. An ABI is an interface that defines how two modules interact with each other at the machine code level. Most often, these modules are applications using external libraries. An ABI defines a low-level and hardware-dependent interface compared to an an Application Programming Interface (API), which is considered high-level and hardware-independent.

        See `ABI <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/BuildSystem/ABI>`_ for more details.

        Related topic(s): :term:`API`.

    ACL
        ACL stands for Access Control List. An ACL is a list of access permissions that defines entities and their access rights to resources. ACLs can specify access with varying levels of granularity, ranging from full access to a resource, to permission for a specific operation.

        See `ACL <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/acl.5.html>`_ for more details.

    GUI
        Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a visual representation of operations within a computer. It is usually represented as icons rather than text only.

    GZIP
        GNU Zip is a :term:`GNU` software package used to reduce a files size of a backup.
        
        - When applied directly to files, it replaces the original file type with a ".gz" type.
        - When used in Bacula's :term:`FileSet`, it reduces the storage size of backed-up directories within Bacula's storage volumes.
        - When used to reduce the size of a folder, it works in combination with a tar tool which first combines multiple files into a single archive, before applying GZIP's size-reduction technique.

    HA
        High Availability (HA) is the process of ensuring that a system is always up. To achieve this, a redundant system is setup that either
        takes over when the main system is down or runs alongside the main system to load balance the workload.

        Related topic(s): High availability, and OpenLDAP.

    HBAs
        Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) are interface cards that connect a server to a storage device.

    HMAC
        A Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a type of :term:`Message Authentication Code (MAC) <MAC>`.
        While a general MAC may use various techniques during combination, HMAC follows a structured way. When a message and its 
        HMAC are sent, the receiver verifies the integrity by computing the HMAC again - if the message is altered, the value will differ.

        Related topic(S): High availability, Kerberos, Cryptography, and Security.

    HMC
        Hardware Management Console (HMC) is used to manage IBM servers. It can handle tasks like configuring network settings, loading Ubuntu installation files and installing the OS.

    hostgroup

    hugepage
        A huge page increases the page size on a host, and as a result, when virtual memory is allocated to an application, there are fewer page table entries required to map the virtual memory to physical memory. The page table entries are stored in Random Access Memory (RAM) and cached in the :term:`Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) <TLB>`.

    jitter
        Jitter is the variation in delay or latency between when data packets are sent and when they are received over a network, causing irregular arrival times at the destination. This variation is often caused by network congestion, packet loss, poor hardware performance or differences in the path packets take.

    journald
        Journald, also known as systemd-journald, is a logging service developed by the systemd project as part of the systemd suite. It collects and stores log messages from various sources, including systemd services, kernel messages, system logs, and application logs. Journald stores logs in a binary format offering advantages, such as storage efficiency, searchability, and most especially structured logging. In containerized systems like Docker, it functions as a logging driver for containers. 

        See `manpage for journald.conf <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/journald.conf.5.html/>`_ for more information.
        See the `Docker journald documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/logging/drivers/journald/>`_ for details on using journald as a logging driver.

        Related topic(s): logging and :term:`Docker`.

    JSON
        **JavaScript Object Notation**:
        This is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar with programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. Due to its simplicity, it is an ideal lightweight data interchange language.

        See `JSON <https://www.json.org/json-en.html/>`_ for more details.

    TLB
        Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a CPU cache that stores recent page table entries. When the CPU translates a virtual address, it first checks the TLB. If the mapping is found, the translation is fast. If it's missing, the CPU retrieves the mapping from the page table in memory, which takes longer.
