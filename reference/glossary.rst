.. glossary::

    ABI
        ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. An ABI is an interface that defines how two modules interact with each other at the machine code level. Most often, these modules are applications using external libraries. An ABI defines a low-level and hardware-dependent interface compared to an an Application Programming Interface (API), which is considered high-level and hardware-independent.

        See `ABI <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/BuildSystem/ABI>`_ for more details.

        Related topic(s): :term:`API`.

    ACL
        ACL stands for Access Control List. An ACL is a list of access permissions that defines entities and their access rights to resources. ACLs can specify access with varying levels of granularity, ranging from full access to a resource, to permission for a specific operation.

        See `ACL <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/acl.5.html>`_ for more details.

    FULLTEXT
 
        FULLTEXT is an index type that allows for fast indexing and searching large quantities of text. It takes a sentence, splits it into words, and links them to row IDs. When a search query for a word is made, MySQL 
        quickly looks up the row the word appear in, and retrieves all matching row IDs, rather than scanning the entire table. It can also find similar words using natural language processing.

        See `Full-Text Search Functions <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/fulltext-search.html>`_ for more details.

    FW

        A firmware (FW) is a software that runs before an operating system (OS) boots.

        - When a QEMU microvm starts, the firmware initializes minimal virtual hardware like allocating RAM to the OS, etc. and then loads the Linux kernel into memory.

        - In a physical device, firmware configures :term:`PCIe` devices like GPUs or network cards.

    jitter
        Jitter is the variation in delay or latency between when data packets are sent and when they are received over a network, causing irregular arrival times at the destination. This variation is often caused by network congestion, packet loss, poor hardware performance or differences in the path packets take.

    journald
        Journald, also known as systemd-journald, is a logging service developed by the systemd project as part of the systemd suite. It collects and stores log messages from various sources, including systemd services, kernel messages, system logs, and application logs. Journald stores logs in a binary format offering advantages, such as storage efficiency, searchability, and most especially structured logging. In containerized systems like Docker, it functions as a logging driver for containers. 

        See `manpage for journald.conf <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/journald.conf.5.html/>`_ for more information.
        See the `Docker journald documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/logging/drivers/journald/>`_ for details on using journald as a logging driver.

        Related topic(s): logging and :term:`Docker`.

    JSON
        **JavaScript Object Notation**:
        This is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar with programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. Due to its simplicity, it is an ideal lightweight data interchange language.

        See `JSON <https://www.json.org/json-en.html/>`_ for more details.
