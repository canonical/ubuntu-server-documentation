.. glossary::

    ABI
        ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. An ABI is an interface that defines how two modules interact with each other at the machine code level. Most often, these modules are applications using external libraries. An ABI defines a low-level and hardware-dependent interface compared to an an Application Programming Interface (API), which is considered high-level and hardware-independent.

        See `ABI <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/BuildSystem/ABI>`_ for more details.

        Related topic(s): :term:`API`.

    ACL
        ACL stands for Access Control List. An ACL is a list of access permissions that defines entities and their access rights to resources. ACLs can specify access with varying levels of granularity, ranging from full access to a resource, to permission for a specific operation.

        See `ACL <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/acl.5.html>`_ for more details.

        Related topic(s): Security, :term:`OpenLDAP`, and :term:`Kerberos`.

    ADSys
        ADSys is an Ubuntu-specific Active Directory client developed by Canonical. ADSys complements System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) by adding native Group Policy Object support, privilege management, and custom scripts execution.

        See `ADSys <https://documentation.ubuntu.com/adsys/en/stable/>`_ for more details.

        Related topic(s): :term:`Group Policy Object` and :term:`SSSD`.

    AES
        AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard. An AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm designed to encrypt data securely into an unreadable format that can only be decrypted with the same key used for encryption.

        Related topic(s): Security.

    Alertmanager
        Alertmanager is an open-source monitoring system developed by the Prometheus project to monitor and handle alerts. It offers several key features, including *Grouping* to combine alerts, *Inhibition* to suppress certain alerts when others are already firing, and *Silencing* to temporarily mute specific alerts.

        See `Alertmanager <https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/>`_ for more details.

    jitter
        Jitter is the variation in delay or latency between when data packets are sent and when they are received over a network, causing irregular arrival times at the destination. This variation is often caused by network congestion, packet loss, poor hardware performance or differences in the path packets take.

    journald
        Journald, also known as systemd-journald, is a logging service developed by the systemd project as part of the systemd suite. It collects and stores log messages from various sources, including systemd services, kernel messages, system logs, and application logs. Journald stores logs in a binary format offering advantages, such as storage efficiency, searchability, and most especially structured logging. In containerized systems like Docker, it functions as a logging driver for containers. 

        See `manpage for journald.conf <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/noble/man5/journald.conf.5.html/>`_ for more information.
        See the `Docker journald documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/logging/drivers/journald/>`_ for details on using journald as a logging driver.

        Related topic(s): logging and :term:`Docker`.

    JSON
        **JavaScript Object Notation**:
        This is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar with programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. Due to its simplicity, it is an ideal lightweight data interchange language.

        See `JSON <https://www.json.org/json-en.html/>`_ for more details.
