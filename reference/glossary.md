ABI
Application Binary Interface
    An ABI is an interface that defines how two modules interact with each other
    at the machine code level. Most often, these modules are applications using
    external libraries. An ABI defines a low-level and hardware-dependent
    interface compared to an {term}`API`, which is considered high-level and
    hardware-independent.

ACL
Access Control List
    An ACL is a list of access permissions that defines entities and their
    access rights to resources. ACLs can specify access with varying levels of
    granularity, ranging from full access to a resource, to permission for a
    specific operation.

    different software programs, allowing them to communicate and exchange data.
    APIs exist on multiple layers of abstraction, from low-level APIs closest
    to system hardware to high-level web APIs that enable clients and remote
    servers to communicate.

AppArmor
    AppArmor is a Linux security module that provides
    {term}`Mandatory Access Control (MAC) <MAC>` for programs. AppArmor
    restricts what applications can do, even when they are compromised. It
    enforces a set of security policies (called profiles) that define what
    files, capabilities, and system resources a given program is allowed to
    access.

Apport
    Apport is a debugging tool and crash reporting system used in Ubuntu and
    Debian-based Linux distributions. It can automatically detect crashes in
    programs and system services, collect detailed diagnostic data, generate
    crash reports, and prompt the user to send the report to developers via
    systems like Launchpad. It is typically disabled by default on production
    systems because it can expose sensitive information in logs, but is used
    during development or testing.

    ({term}`MAC address`) on a local area network (LAN).

    Related topic(s):
    * Networking

async
asynchronous
    A term commonly used in programming to describe operations that take place
    without blocking the main execution thread. Instead of waiting for a
    particular operation to finish (such as reading a file or making a network
    request), "async" programs can keep running other operations in the meantime.
    These operations are often dispatched to the background, allowing them to
    run in parallel. If needed, however, the program can still wait for the
    result of an asynchronous operation.

    Related topic(s):
    * Concurrency, parallelism, and threading

Authenticator
    An authenticator is any system, method, or mechanism used to verify a
    user's identity during the authentication process. It can range from
    something as simple as a password field (e.g., LDAP {term}`bind`) to more
    advanced tools like biometric scanners or one-time code generators.
    Authenticators are essential components of authentication protocols and can
    be used in both single-factor and multi-factor authentication setups.

    Related topic(s):
    * OpenLDAP, authentication

autocommit
    autocommit is a database feature that automatically commits every
    individual SQL statement as soon as it is executed. When autocommit is
    enabled, every SQL statement is treated as its own transaction and is
    applied immediately and permanently.

    This means it is impossible to undo or roll back a statement executed with
    autocommit enabled. While autocommit is a common default in many systems,
    behavior can vary depending on the database or language bindings. For
    example, in Python's `sqlite3` module, Python 3.12 introduces changes to
    transaction control, allowing explicit control over autocommit mode.

autodetect
    autodetect is the ability of a system to automatically detect and configure
    hardware or settings without user input. In Ubuntu Server and other Linux
    systems, this is used during boot or installation to identify devices like
    disks, network interfaces, or keyboard layouts. The kernel, installers, and
    configuration tools rely on autodetection to simplify setup by loading the
    right drivers and defaults based on the system's hardware and environment.

    Related topic(s):
    * Kernel modules

autoinstall
    Autoinstall is a feature in Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server that provides
    fully automated installations using a pre-defined configuration file. This
    file describes how the system should be installed, including disk
    partitioning, user accounts, package selection, and network settings.

GPS
Global Positioning System
    GPS is a collection of satellites that provides accurate time using radio
    signals from their atomic clocks. A GPS receiver plugged into a computer
    can sync with these satellites and generate {term}`PPS` signal, which
    delivers ultra-accurate time that applications can use as a time source.

GPSD
GPS daemon
    This reads data from a GPS receiver and makes it available as a shared
    resource to multiple applications (e.g., {term}`Chrony`) to use for precise
    time synchronization.

GSSAPI
Generic Security Services Application Program Interface
    GSSAPI is a vendor-agnostic {term}`API` that uses an existing communication
    protocol to establish a secure communication between applications. It does
    this securely by verifying user credentials, ensuring that data being
    transmitted remains unchanged, preventing unauthorized access, and securely
    negotiating encryption keys.

GUI
Graphical User Interface
    A GUI is a visual representation of operations within a computer. It is
    usually represented as icons rather than text only.

GZIP
GNU Zip
    GZIP is a {term}`GNU` software package used to reduce the file size of a
    backup.
    
    - When applied directly to files, it replaces the original file type with a
      `.gz` type.
    - When used in Bacula's {term}`fileset`, it reduces the storage size of
      backed-up directories within Bacula's storage volumes.
    - When used to reduce the size of a folder, it works in combination with a
      `tar` tool which first combines multiple files into a single archive,
      before applying GZIP's size-reduction technique.

HA
High Availability
    HA is the process of ensuring that a system is always up. To achieve this,
    a redundant system is set up that either takes over when the main system is
    down or runs alongside the main system to load-balance the workload.

HMAC
Hash-based Message Authentication Code
    A HMAC is a type of {term}`Message Authentication Code <MAC>`. While a
    general MAC may use various techniques during combination, HMAC follows a
    structured way. When a message and its HMAC are sent, the receiver verifies
    the integrity by computing the HMAC again -- if the message is altered, the
    value will differ.

HMC
Hardware Management Console
    A HMC is used to manage IBM servers. It can handle tasks like
    configuring network settings, loading Ubuntu installation files and
    installing the {term}`OS`.

hostgroup
    A group of backend web or database servers with similar configurations.

hostname
    A hostname identifies a server using a word rather than an {term}`IP address`.
    This makes it easier to remember.

HOTP
HMAC-based One-Time Password
    HOTP generates a one-time password by using the {term}`HMAC` algorithm in
    combination with a counter. When a client presents the {term}`OTP`, the
    server compares it with OTPs generated within a specific counter window to
    find a match.

hotplug
    The process of adding or removing a device (USB, disks, etc.) while a
    virtual machine is running.

HPB
Host Physical Bits
    HPB are appended to the name of an Ubuntu machine type. It signifies that a
    virtual machine will use the same number of bits the host {term}`CPU` uses
    to point to physical memory.

jitter
    Jitter is the variation in delay or latency between when data packets are
    sent and when they are received over a network, causing irregular arrival
    times at the destination. This variation is often caused by network
    congestion, packet loss, poor hardware performance or differences in the
    path packets take.

journald
    `journald`, also known as `systemd-journald`, is a logging service
    developed by the {term}`systemd` project as part of the `systemd` suite. It
    collects and stores log messages from various sources, including `systemd`
    services, kernel messages, system logs, and application logs. `journald`
    stores logs in a binary format offering advantages, such as storage
    efficiency, searchability, and most especially structured logging. In
    containerized systems like Docker, it functions as a logging driver for
    containers. 

    See also:
    * The {manpage}`journald.conf(5)` manual page
