Contribute to this documentation
********************************

Contributing to documentation can be a fantastic way to get started as a
contributor to open source projects, no matter your level of experience!

The Ubuntu Server Guide is a collaborative effort between Canonical and the
Ubuntu community, and ALL types of contributions are welcome; whether you're
new to Ubuntu Server and want to highlight something you found confusing, or
you're an expert and want to create guides to help others.

We hope to make it as easy as possible to contribute. If you find any part of
our process doesn't work well for you, please let us know!

The Open Documentation Academy
==============================

Ubuntu Server is a proud member of the Canonical
`Open Documentation Academy`_ (ODA). If you are a newcomer to making open
source contributions, or new to technical writing and want to boost your
skills -- or both! -- we will be glad to help.

Check out the ODA repository for guidance and useful resources on getting
started.

Prerequisites
=============

There are some prerequisites to contributing to Ubuntu Server documentation.

- **Code of Conduct**
  You will need to read and agree to the Ubuntu `Code of Conduct`_. By
  participating, you implicitly agree to abide by the Code of Conduct. 

- **GitHub account**
  You need a `GitHub account`_ to create issues, comment, reply, or submit
  contributions.

  You don't need to know ``git`` before you start, and you definitely don't
  need to work on the command line if you don't want to. Many documentation
  tasks can be done using `GitHub's web interface`_. On the command line, we
  use the standard "fork and pull" process.

- **Licensing**
  The first time you contribute to a Canonical project, you will need to sign
  the Canonical License agreement (CLA). If you have already signed it, e.g.
  when contributing to another Canonical project, you do not need to sign it
  again.
  
  This license protects your copyright over your contributions, including the
  right to use them elsewhere, but grants us (Canonical) permission to use
  them in our project. You can read `more about the CLA`_ before you
  `sign the CLA`_.

The Ubuntu Server docs overview
===============================

This documentation is `hosted in GitHub`_ and rendered on Read the Docs. You
need to create a `GitHub account`_ to participate, but you do not need a Read
the Docs account.

Contribution types
==================

There are many different ways to contribute to the Ubuntu Server documentation,
including many options that don't require any coding knowledge. To find out
more, check out the :ref:`contrib-types` page.

General workflow
================

Most contributions are made on GitHub by working on your machine and submitting
your changes in a pull request (PR) via the command line. This workflow is
outlined in these broad steps:

- :ref:`Find an issue to work on <finding-issues>`
- :ref:`Fetch the documentation to your machine <build-locally>`
- Work on the issue (:ref:`get help <get-help>` if you need it!)
- :ref:`Test your contribution <doc-testing>`
- :ref:`Submit it for review <submit-work>`

The Ubuntu Server documentation is very large and comprehensive! If you can't
find an issue you want to work on, feel free to look around the docs and
see what improvements you think you can make.

For spelling and grammatical changes on a page, which are quick and easy to
submit, feel free to create a PR. For more substantial changes or suggestions,
we suggest creating an issue first, so that we can discuss and agree on an
approach before you spend time working on it.

Make sure you check the issue list before submitting a PR - if you start
working on a task that is listed and already assigned to someone else, we
unfortunately won't be able to accept your PR.

Thank you!
==========

Lastly, we would like to thank you for spending your time to help make the
Ubuntu Server documentation better. Every step in the right direction is a step
worth taking, no matter how large or small.
