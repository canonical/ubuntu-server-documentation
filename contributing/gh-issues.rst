Find issues to work on
======================

We use GitHub issues to track documentation tasks. Start by checking out
`the issues list`_ to see if there are any tasks you'd like to work on. We
use labels to help filter the tasks that need to be done and to show whether
they’re assigned to someone or not.

When you find a task you want to work on, leave a comment on the issue saying
you’d like to adopt the task, with an estimated date for when you hope to
complete it. One of the documentation maintainers will respond and assign
that task to you.

.. note::
   There is no time limit for completing a task, but if you need more time,
   need help, or won't be able to complete the issue after all, make sure to
   comment on the issue to let us know. It's expected and normal that things
   don't always go to plan!

Each issue can be worked on by a single person, and each person can work on one
issue at a time. You can see which issues are unassigned by selecting
"Assigned to nobody" from the "Assignee" drop-down menu. Or `use this link`_.

.. _issue-labels:

Issue labels
------------

We use the following issue labels to help manage tasks. If you are looking for
certain types of tasks, you can filter the issues list by label. The labels
are grouped together into the following categories.

Note that we don't use the **help wanted** or **good first issue** labels. All
the issues we have can be considered as available for anyone who wants to work
on them.

Diataxis
^^^^^^^^

We use `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ to organise our documentation. 
Revise a document to better conform to a  type:
This may require a document to be split, edited, or sometimes re-written.

Size
^^^^

Our estimate of the time needed, effort and/or complexity needed to complete
the task. Using a
`Fibonacci sequence <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence>`_, of
1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, where 1 represents a straightforward task (least effort),
up to 8, which is likely to be a significant or complex undertaking.
