# Page title

Try to include a brief text to say what will (and if needed, what will not) be
covered in the guide.

## Prerequisites

If there are any steps the reader needs to complete before starting this guide
you can outline them here. This might include suggested pre-reading if there
are things they need to know (or other pages they should refer to) before they
start.

## Install <package>

Include the steps needed to install the package or software you are
documenting.

## Configure <package>

Include the configuration options. This section can be quite long, so it's a
good idea to break up the page a bit with level 3 (`###`) subheaders to
separate content into logical "chunks". In this way, the reader can choose to
use the in-page table of contents to navigate the page.

## (Optional) information on using the package

If there are best practices, examples, or other information you want to include
that might help the reader, feel free to do so!

## Further reading

Often when you are researching a topic you will come up with a list of
resources you found helpful. Try to use reputable links such as official
upstream documentation or books.
