Issue labels
------------

We use the following issue labels to help manage tasks. If you are looking for
certain types of tasks, you can filter the issues list by label. The labels
are grouped together into the following categories.

Note that we don't use the **help wanted** or **good first issue** labels. All
the issues we have can be considered as available for anyone who wants to work
on them.

Coding level  
^^^^^^^^^^^^

These labels correspond to the different types of contributions that we accept
according to the details in the :ref:`contrib-types` page.

- :guilabel:`code: technical`
- :guilabel:`code: coding`
- :guilabel:`code: low-code`
- :guilabel:`code: non-code`

Content  
^^^^^^^

These labels are used to mark out issues related to content. They will often
also have a `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ label to give more context.

- :guilabel:`content: update`

  Update specific instructions, commands, or version numbers.

- :guilabel:`content: edit`

  Edit existing content for consistency, accuracy, style, completeness and/or
  adherence to Diátaxis.

- :guilabel:`content: new`

  Add new documentation for a specific tool, feature, or function.

Diataxis
^^^^^^^^

We use `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ to organise our documentation. This
label is used to suggest what documentation type the page in question belongs
to. If you have a preference for writing how-to guides, for instance, you may
want to filter by the ``how-to`` label.

If you want to suggest a missing guide, or have ideas about content you want to
create, please make an issue first so we can discuss/agree upon the scope and
how it will fit into the broader documentation.

- :guilabel:`dia: tutorial`

  Develop, write, or update a `tutorial <https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/>`_.
  Tutorials are often the hardest kind of documentation to create because they
  need good teaching skills before you even start writing.

- :guilabel:`dia: how-to`

  Create or update a `how-to guide <https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/>`_ to
  achieve a specific goal. All our how-to guides follow a specific format - you
  can use our how-to template to help you (located in the
  ``contributing/doc-templates`` folder).

- :guilabel:`dia: explanation`

  Create or update an understanding-oriented
  `explanation <https://diataxis.fr/explanation/>`_.

- :guilabel:`dia: reference`

  Create or update `reference <https://diataxis.fr/reference/>`_ material.

ODA
^^^

The :guilabel:`ODA` label is used to show that this issue is also listed on the
Canonical Open Documentation Academy.

Review
^^^^^^

Review existing documentation. You may want to propose small updates to the
original page after your review, or create a follow-up issue if you find
substantial problems.

- :guilabel:`review: wording`

  Review the quality, clarity, and consistency of the wording. This may lead to
  follow-up edits.

- :guilabel:`review: technical`

  Review the technical accuracy, completeness, and up-to-dateness of the
  content. This may require follow-up updates.

Server labels
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The set of :guilabel:`Server:` issues labels are for the maintainers of the
repository to flag up possible problems with the listed issue or pull request.

Issues with the :guilabel:`Server: WIP` label are not intended to be worked on
currently, either because they lack detail, need investigation, or need
further instructions to be provided.
