I want to contribute new pages
==============================

Firstly, thank you! 

Documentation at Canonical is undergoing a transformation, which includes our adoption of [the Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) for structuring the Server Guide (for context, we are currently about halfway through this restructuring). Our Community team has put together a [helpful set of resources](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/contribute-to-documentation/33966) to give contributors an overview of the changes we're making.

The rest of this page is dedicated to giving you all the information you need to get started!

Make sure there are no pages on your chosen topic
-------------------------------------------------

As much as possible, we want the Server Guide to be easy to navigate, so we try to avoid repetition. New documentation should be created to fit into the hierarchy of pages which already exist. If you are unsure of where the page should go, or think we need a new section, please [have a discussion about it first](/t/server-guide-feedback-and-suggestions/38718)!

However, if you've spotted a gap and want to fill it...

Make a draft
-------------

You should have an idea in mind before you start about what style of page you want to write, according to the Diataxis framework:
   
 * A [tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/), to guide users through some aspect of Ubuntu Server in a sandboxed environment.
 * A [how-to guide](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/), providing the steps to achieve a particular task. 
 * An [explanation](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/) of a particular topic, or
 * A [reference](https://diataxis.fr/reference/) page.

You can write your draft online, directly in Discourse, if you want to see a preview of how the Markdown will render. If you prefer to work offline, software such as VSCode also has the ability to show a Markdown preview. See [below for more information](#general-tips-for-discourse-markdown) on writing and editing in Discourse.

If you get stuck on the draft stage and need some guidance or want a review before you post, you are very welcome to contact our [technical author, Sally](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/u/sally-makin). 

Post your content on the forum
------------------------------
   
As mentioned earlier, our documentation is created from selected forum posts, so the first step is to make a post in the ["guide" section of the Server forum](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/guide/26) by clicking on the "`+ New Topic`" button on the top right of the linked page.

In your new post, enter the title (the level 1 heading) into the form field that says "`Type title, or paste a link here`". This will be automatically rendered as the page title, so there's no need to include a level 1 header in the body of the page, or to include any formatting around the header.
   
Paste the content of your page into the main field. Double check that the page is rendering as you expected using the preview window. Make sure you are happy with the page before you click on the "`+ create topic`" button. Depending on your Discourse trust level, you may not be able to edit your post after 24 hours has passed so make sure to address any unexpected differences right away. 

Get your page added to the navigation
-------------------------------------

After your post is created, make a note of the generated URL. If you're already in contact with our [technical author, Sally](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/u/sally-makin), or another one of the admins on the Server section, you can send them the URL and they will add it to the correct part of the Server Guide for you.

After your page has been added to the site navigation, the next time you go back to the Server Guide documentation page, you should be able to see your page -- congratulations! 

> **Note**: 
> If your page doesn't appear within a few minutes, try refreshing the page to clear the cached version.
