Types of contributions
======================

There are many different ways to contribute, no matter your level of prior
knowledge. 

Technical
---------

These types of tasks might require you to have a good amount of prior
experience with servers, networking, hardware, or related topics. This might
include:

- Technical reviews
- Technical updates

It could also include creating content, if you would like to submit a guide on
how to accomplish a specific task, or an explanation of a topic. 

Code options
------------

We may sometimes have issues that require knowledge of a particular coding
language, or some sort of technical expertise (such as understanding how to
create GitHub actions or Vale rules) to fulfil.

- Creating vale rules
- Improving our GitHub actions and workflows

Low-code options
----------------

If you spot something in the documentation that could be improved (or needs to
be corrected), the best way to contribute is to report it to us so we can fix
it! This could include (but isn't limited to):

* Spelling/grammar errors
* Broken links
* Code snippets that don't work as expected
* Things you didn't understand or that could be explained more clearly
* Testing tutorials and how-to guide steps

At the bottom of every page in the documentation, you will find a link that says "Help improve this document in the forum". Clicking this link will take you to the corresponding Discourse post.

Underneath each post you may find a thread, or several threads, of discussion about the topic. You can add your comment by clicking "reply" on the original post. If there is already a discussion happening about the thing you want to report, you can also jump into the conversation by replying to one of the existing comments.
