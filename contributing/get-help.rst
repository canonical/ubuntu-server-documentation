Getting help
************

You might occasionally run into problems -- this is normal and expected! We
will do our best to help.

Directly on GitHub issues
=========================

Each issue should contain a description of the task to be completed, and some
suggestions for how you might want to tackle it if there are several options.
You can always ask a question on an issue to ask for more information if there
is something missing or some clarification if the issue is confusingly
presented.

If you have not been able to work on the issue for a while, please leave a
comment to let us know. This helps us to know if you intend to complete the
task, and to reassign the task to someone else if you know you will not be able
to finish it.

If you want help from another contributor, that's also fine! Leave a comment
describing the problem you're facing and what help you need to resolve it.

Help with your submission
=========================

Your pull request will be assigned a reviewer from among the repository
maintainers. You can contact them by leaving a comment on your own PR - you can
also "ping" them in that comment to send them a notification by using
``@<their username>``.

Community forums
================

For more general questions about Ubuntu Server, you're welcome to
`create a post`_ on the Ubuntu Server forum.

You can also use the `Open Documentation Academy forum`_ for questions about
documentation specifically. This forum is the hub the Open Documentation
Academy. It includes our Getting started guide and links to our weekly
Documentation office hours, alongside meeting notes, updates, external links
and discussions.

Synchronous chat
================

For more interactive chat, the documentation team `can be found on Matrix`_.

Calendar
========

Subscribe to the `Documentation event calendar`_. Not only does this include
the Documentation office hours, it will also include any other discussion or
training events we organise.
